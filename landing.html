                                                                                          <p>As the current market shifts and alters in regards to the advancement of science and it’s fields, it is natural for masters applicants to shape an opinion 
                                                                                         regarding this change. As one of those applicants, I have chosen to focus on a data science degree as I’ve realized that the general field of computer science is a large component 
                                                                                         for the growth of our current market, and I wish to be a part of this development. My assignment covers investigation into this matter, as well as highlighting the reasoning of my personal choice.
                                                                                         In the academic paper of Vasant Dhar, ‘Data Science and Prediction’, various academic definitions are given. It is mentioned that science is the systemic approach to acquiring knowledge.
                                                                                         Subsequently, data science is defined by Vasant Dharin in his article of ‘Data Science and Prediction’, as the focus of this systemic approach involving data as well as various other variables. 
                                                                                         These variables are defined by the author as different fields of science, as well as practices such as the systematic study of data ,regarding its properties,organization and analysis 
                                                                                         ,translating it into reliable deductions. The author insists that data science is a field separate of the previously mentioned variables and as such sets a need in the market for employment for 
                                                                                         individuals that have academic or previous experience within this field specifically, different from the previously stated. As such, the term computer science can be defined as the application
                                                                                         of science within a computerized environment, using previously mentioned variables. It is stated in the article ‘data science and prediction’ by Vasant Dhar, that the correlation between 
                                                                                         these two sectors could be defined as the predictive accuracy used by computers. Consequently, it is natural to say that by using the information presented in the article, these two sectors are 
                                                                                         linked and specifically that one may encapsule the other as a subcategory within its own field. This article manages to formulate this connection as it states the core category to be computer science, 
                                                                                         as data science is stated to be the product of a surge of computer based collected data in the new age.</p> 

<p>The article used above, states that as databases expand, the constant need for education is apparent, as to handle most current matters regarding the field.
In agreement to the previous statement, there is a constant need for the educating and employment of data scientists to be able to supply with these demands. 
Regarding this, the market has influenced universities and various other establishments to employ methods to educate potential candidates for these positions.
Specifically speaking, throughout the previous article it is mentioned that the employment market for data scientists has increased within recent years
,as noted within the article ‘Bridging the demand and the offer in data science’ by Adam S.Z. Belloum, Spiros Koulouzis, Tomasz Wiktorski and Andrea Manieri.
With this in mind, I have formulated the decision of educating myself within this specific field as a means to acquiring a position in the data science field of employment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in regards to this personal decision of studying within this field, an additional reason as to why I am currently seeking to pursue a masters 
degree in this field is stated in the ‘2015 data science salary survey’, written by King, J. and Magoulas, R. ,that relays the information 
that ‘the median annual base salary for a starting data scientist is $91,000’. This information relays to my person, that attaining a position within this 
field will provide me with financial security and potential for salary growth. Additionally, these figures according to the ‘2015 data science survey’ by King, J. and Magoulas, R.
,have been consistent over time. These elements were one of the defining factors in my decision to study data science as a master’s degree. Besides the previous stated fact, 
I chose this path as it offered a fixed set of hours in most employment positions, as referred to in the article by J.King and R.Magoulas, ‘2015 data science survey’. 
This allows me to experience other opportunities outside of my employment hours, as it provides me with some time for leisure activities. 
In agreement with my previous statement, I also chose this path, as a way to further explore my abilities in programming and statistics
,as well as my passion for science and learning. Lastly, It is important to note that the prospect of new academics in the field will resort in more accurate results 
regarding the handling of large databases and thus more accurate solutions for various issues, which is referred to in the article ‘Data Science and Prediction’. 
The result of a larger pool of specialists is the insurance of outcomes with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I wish to be part of this unit of professionals, adding to the discovery and innovation within the data science field
,whilst allowing to possess all the benefits I have stated above.</p>

											<h2> Unit 1 & 2 </h2>
											<h3> Collobarative Learning Discussion </h3>
											<p> This assignment called for research of inofrmation given by specific articles (Saxena, P. (2021) 
											There Will Be a Shortage of Data Science Jobs in the Next 5 Years?; Yildirim, S. (2020) The Dark 
											Side of the Sexiest Job of the 21st Century), of which an essay must've been supplied in order 
											to portray a specific position regarding the data scientist profession and the various facets. </p>
											
											
											
											
											It is noted by Van der Aalst W.M.P. (2014) that through the increase in processing and storing capabilities 
											within data, companies have recognized the necessity of a data scientist within their establishment. 
											As technological growth and the expansion of databases (Kyriacou, 2022) continuously transpires, the field 
											has employed certain systems and technologies in place for the harnessing of data, as to achieve the greatest 
											possible success and in most instances greater revenue for of an establishment (Mkonto, 2022), changing the nature 
											of the position of the data scientist. The staggering and dramatic growth of technology (Saxena, P., 2021; 
											Yildirim, S., 2020; Mkonto, 2022) during the fourth industrial revolution, has invoked the rapid growth of AI 
											and as such stipulating the a continuum of growth. As such, invoking the expression of new needs regarding the 
											handling of larger data. The notion of the handling of larger data (Big Data), has been employed by companies 
											in search of profit and research (Kyriacou, 2022; Koilakos, 2022), in regards to the expansion of database 
											systems. This finding has led to the employment of computing systems as to achieve immediate results, in 
											contrast to previous generations of which these specific processes would take lengthy periods of time, formulating
											immediate processes. With this occurrence transpiring, the re-evaluation of the collective required skillset
											for a data scientist emerges. As computing systems emerge as lead sources of influence regarding the data science 
											field, industrialized computing systems, central frameworks and security standards take the initiative in the 
											field. Consequently, data scientists must be able to handle and execute these items, being able to excel in 
											machine learning. The use of Master Data Management can be condoned as an item within this category and may be 
											defined as a system to manage data to eliminate error, formulating data into a system and acquiring a scheme 
											for success for each company individually and other such programs. Consequently, it has been inherently 
											effortless by specialized data professionals to obtain immediate data for the conveyance of conclusions. 
											Adhering this system of items, it is important to additionally mention the use of ISMS (information security 
											management system), the ISO 27000 Family of Standards and GDFR compliance as they all stand as tools within 
											the possession of a specialized data scientist. The execution and handling of these items are in consensus 
											with the agenda of a specialized data scientist. These programs may be defined as items directly involved with 
											the rise of technology, programming languages and various skillsets, that have been integrated into the data 
											science profession, intertwining the data analytics skillset and programming skill 
											(Smolan, R. and Erwitt, J., 2012; Koilakos, 2022) into the daily basis of a specialized data professional. 
											Defining these items, as central frameworks and implement security standards as to protect and promote the 
											growth of accessible data. As such, the implications of technological growth, transform the role of a 
											data scientist from a simple implementation specialist to a specialized user of interface, programming, 
											and knowledge holder of various industries (Koilakos, 2022; Foley,2022; Kyriacou, 2022), such as mathematics
											and statistics, for the satisfaction of the needs of a position as a data scientist. This further instigates 
											the development of a statement for the future of the field, which is the necessity of the human implication. 
											Currently, these processes must be instigated with human intervention, as AI has not secured this task and 
											due to the maintenance of company profit independence the need for human intervention is a necessity 
											(Yildirim, S.,2020). This in turn has invoked a chain reaction. The data scientist as to ensure employment, 
											manifests the characteristics of an ideal candidate for the position and as such employs various methods to 
											succeed this. This notion leading to the upcoming transformation of what we recognize the responsibilities of 
											an individual in the data science position, to possess. As the previous statements as per a wider reading, 
											cultivate our current reality, the employment of generalized data professionals will inevitably slow down 
											and become slim, as the flow of generalized data professionals will suffice for the needs of the then market. 
											As such, the expression of a need for specialized data professionals with skillsets and knowledge from a 
											culminationof sectors (Foley, 2022) will become apparent as to become accustomed to the advancement of the 
											then technology. This becomes apparent currently with the employment of individuals with specific skills 
											(e.g. programming skills as related to data science) and specialization (e.g. cognitive specialist) of over 
											others that do not possess these specific skills and lack of specialization. In conclusion, a current 
											data professional must seek constant advancement and progression in terms of skillsets and program handling, 
											as to seek out employment opportunities, adhering to the demands of the current market, whilst ensuring 
											a position in the future market. While lastly, a specialized data professional must retain a wider knowledge, 
											constantly advancing on a broad range of fields of science, as to keep up to par with the constant advancements 
											in technologies, AI and computing systems.

This essay seeks to create a more consice image with regards to the context I previously constructed. </h3>
                                            
                                            <h4>It is noted by Van der Aalst W.M.P. (2014) that through the increase in processing and storing capabilities within data, companies have recognized the necessity of a data scientist within their establishment. As technological growth and the expansion of databases (Kyriacou, 2022) continuously transpires, the field has employed certain systems and technologies in place for the harnessing of data, as to achieve the greatest possible success and in most instances greater revenue for of an establishment (Mkonto, 2022), changing the nature of the position of the data scientist.

The staggering and dramatic growth of technology (Saxena, P., 2021; Yildirim, S., 2020; Mkonto, 2022) during the fourth industrial revolution, has invoked the rapid growth of AI and as such stipulating the a continuum of growth. As such, invoking the expression of new needs regarding the handling of larger data. The notion of the handling of larger data (Big Data), has been employed by companies in search of profit and research (Kyriacou, 2022; Koilakos, 2022), in regards to the expansion of database systems. This finding has led to the employment of computing systems as to achieve immediate results, in contrast to previous generations of which these specific processes would take lengthy periods of time, formulating immediate processes. With this occurrence transpiring, the re-evaluation of the collective required skillset for a data scientist emerges. 

As computing systems emerge as lead sources of influence regarding the data science field, industrialized computing systems, central frameworks and security standards take the initiative in the field. Consequently, data scientists must be able to handle and execute these items, being able to excel in machine learning. The use of Master Data Management can be condoned as an item within this category and may be defined as a system to manage data to eliminate error, formulating data into a system and acquiring a scheme for success for each company individually and other such programs. Consequently, it has been inherently effortless by specialized data professionals to obtain immediate data for the conveyance of conclusions. Adhering this system of items, it is important to additionally mention the use of ISMS (information security management system), the ISO 27000 Family of Standards and GDFR compliance as they all stand as tools within the possession of a specialized data scientist. The execution and handling of these items are in consensus with the agenda of a specialized data scientist. These programs may be defined as items directly involved with the rise of technology, programming languages and various skillsets, that have been integrated into the data science profession, intertwining the data analytics skillset and programming skill (Smolan, R. and Erwitt, J., 2012; Koilakos, 2022) into the daily basis of a specialized data professional. Defining these items, as central frameworks and implement security standards as to protect and promote the growth of accessible data.

As such, the implications of technological growth, transform the role of a data scientist from a simple implementation specialist to a specialized user of interface, programming, and knowledge holder of various industries (Koilakos, 2022; Foley,2022; Kyriacou, 2022), such as mathematics and statistics, for the satisfaction of the needs of a position as a data scientist. This further instigates the development of a statement for the future of the field, which is the necessity of the human implication. Currently, these processes must be instigated with human intervention, as AI has not secured this task and due to the maintenance of company profit independence the need for human intervention is a necessity (Yildirim, S.,2020). This in turn has invoked a chain reaction. The data scientist as to ensure employment, manifests the characteristics of an ideal candidate for the position and as such employs various methods to succeed this. This notion leading to the upcoming transformation of what we recognize the responsibilities of an individual in the data science position, to possess. 

As the previous statements as per a wider reading, cultivate our current reality, the employment of generalized data professionals will inevitably slow down and become slim, as the flow of generalized data professionals will suffice for the needs of the then market. As such, the expression of a need for specialized data professionals with skillsets and knowledge from a culmination of sectors (Foley, 2022) will become apparent as to become accustomed to the advancement of the then technology. This becomes apparent currently with the employment of individuals with specific skills (e.g. programming skills as related to data science) and specialization (e.g. cognitive specialist) of over others that do not possess these specific skills and lack of specialization. In conclusion, a current data professional must seek constant advancement and progression in terms of skillsets and program handling, as to seek out employment opportunities, adhering to the demands of the current market, whilst ensuring a position in the future market. While lastly, a specialized data professional must retain a wider knowledge, constantly advancing on a broad range of fields of science, as to keep up to par with the constant advancements in technologies, AI and computing systems.</h4>

                                            <h4>My interaction with data as an abstract idea has fascinated my person
since I began my studies in the undergraduate level, as I became accustom
to ideas concerning programming and information technologies as part of
my studies. My inquiries on the matter have always stemmed from a side of
concern regarding data protection, as a core part of one’s identity is the
information, they relay about themselves. This preludes that through
gaining access to one’s information, another body may replicate the identity
given. This inherent worry has manifested in the creation of certain
regulations prescribed by the EU, reflecting the protection of data
sentiments I previously mentioned.
Evidently, in an age of constant technological growth, it is inherent for
effective strategies of security to accommodate these advancements. The
implementation of principles by the European commission has allowed data
to be regulated within a specific marked criteria. Implemented in 2016 by
the European Commission, its relevance to the industry of data science
and the flourishing prevalence of the expansion of the data pool as a result
of the continuous database expansion (Saxena, P. (2021), is noted. The
continuous growth and expansion of databases and formative growth being
experienced in relation to this field, produces new expectations regarding

data usage and handling by corporations, as to protect the user and enable
trust by the user within the EU and abroad. As regarded by the e-Privacy
regulation, this framework stands as a buffer between the user and the
data, inherently through interacting with the article, it becomes apparent as
a user of this wider reading that this framework stands as a ground of moral
and ethical support with great regard to the user and as such is an aid for
the user as to avoid third party hinderance on the individual person.
This amongst other things, guarantees through my perspective, a
protection of rights of an individual person against the plethora of
challenges that come adjacent to an individual realizing the potential of
data in the 21 st century. By engaging through a wider reading with the article
conducted by the European commission in 2019, named “Data protection
rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond – taking stock”, my
understanding is that although the principles of the previously mentioned
framework is impacted with further changes, the main body remains
prevalent in its main core as a structure, this allowing for the additional
support towards previous claims of enabling trust within the EU and
abroad. This adherently, in concern to recent claims regarding data
protection (Lorio, P., 2017; Lee, I., 2021 ), is a tool used for the eradication of these
concerns, as stated in the previous article by the EU conducted in 2019
and of which I’ve grasped my conclusions from. Due to this, it has been
understood by my person, that as to avoid penalizations, the EU set a
timeline of which this initiative would take effective action and thus, urged
corporations to adjust to these recent revelations, as in that time, data
breaches had been occurring frequently, and concern was raised regarding
this issue (Lee, I., 2021).
As per this action, noting the many alterations that were proposed during
this alteration period, regarding the framework set by the European
Commission in an attempt to safeguard data as a singular and quantative
unit, corporations were noticed to adhere to these policies and acquire a
primary group or individual body of data controllers as per company, relying
on this body of expertise to navigate through the regulations and adhere to
them, as to change the principles of any collective body, enterprise or
company, to invoke a compliance with these rules of data structures and
regulations (Müller, N.M., Kowatsch, D., Debus, P., Mirdita, D. and
Böttinger, K., 2019; WLG, G., n.d.; Deloitte, 2017).
This is noted in the various notices of the IT business code of conduct with
regard to various companies, invoking on the principles and rules proposed
by the European Commission, imposing on businesses residing in part or
entirely in Europe, as to create a complete and cohesive code of conduct
based on these principles. Invoking on this action, I have noticed the
prevalence of this factor within the multinational company “Starbucks”,

which operates in most of the western world. This organisation defines
itself as a widespread chain of coffee establishments, essentially, that has
established it&#39;s position in food deliverance and coffee supply, as well.
Adherently, at a swift glance it is noted that the code of conduct is relational
to the IT business code of conduct and practices of an informative or
inquisitive nature, regarding data, adhere to the most efficient demand of
practices concerning data and obey the principles I have previously
mentioned. 
Gaining introspection onto the matter of the code of conduct of this specific
company, has allowed my person to gain insight on potential practices and
policy, as to pertain on whether the company is accustom to the guidelines
of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) dealt by the European
Commission and as I’ve previously mentioned use of the optimum data
handling and management methods (MDM-Master Data Management).
 
On a singular level the IT business code of conduct of the specific
company, is met with various successful points of which I have noted by
way of reading it.
In relation to previous years, it is noted that several breaches have
occurred and as such, organizations due to this had to implement
alterations as to counter the effect of the actual or potential breaches. This,
in terms of company policy and practices, has resulted in the insurance of
quality data and the lawful conduct of the enterprise within current years, as
from the implementation of these principles. Entities such as the quality of
singular data and the mass manipulation of data structures have resulted in
a newfound diameter of security and protection for data, in regards to the
user, as well as the approximation of value that ease the use of a user.
These previously mentioned structures have allowed the systems that
produce data to be effectively cross-examined with MDM strategies, thus
creating accurate resources of data. The recent collective structurization of
data systems and the abundance of data have sourced a generous pool of
information, in specified criteria and in a wider perspective for the handling
and manipulation of industries for profit and gain. This quality data, in
regards to the recent adjustments of the GDPR principles have allowed for
the processing of data as a product of permission and ethical conduct
through a validation process, such as cookies or a written request or via
email. Consequently, allowing for the practices of MDM to be noticeable to
an individual willing to examine the information at hand, whilst also
validating this data as qualifies for lawful use, as suggested by the GDPR.
The practices of MDM have allowed for data controllers to deal with these
structures as per the European commission, which created the GDPR

principles, simultaneously transferring an immense amount of responsibility
onto the data controlling body on the case.
Additionally, it became apparent to my person that principles such as the
principle of data destruction that proceeds the intent of use and the
induction of practices that regulate the autonomy of the enterprise’s control
on the user’s data, stands apparent within the notice. The quality of data
having been affected by an inquisitive process dealt by data controllers of
which information systems may handle for the correct validation process of
information, adheres to further principles of the GDPR. The data controllers
resuming their part must inquire on users, as per the maintenance of their
information. This as a process, maintains the responsibility of validating the
data and the principles of the GDPR to rely on the data controllers and
lastly as the proceeding body, approved by the enterprise, is included as a
principle of the GDPR. Adhering to this stance, I noticed the categorization
of information and it’s over all control by the responsible parties, accessing
when necessary, the data system to reveal a multi-faceted and complete
scheme of information as per each user, which is in turn a principle of the
MDM, clearly obtained by the permission of the user. Subsequently, the
utilization of the data governance has a common body as both seek to
improve data for the protection and validity of information systems and the
user. 
 
Furthermore, the business goals of the specific enterprise, innovate the
data structures. Subsequently, the data corresponds to the needs of the
business goals, as such, means such as location of the user and retaining
information that corresponds to preferences, results in optimum profit in
regards to the implementation of measures regarding taste and preference,
as is the creation of new drinks based on these preferences or change of
recipe or the creation of new stores regarding the location of users through
the use of the enterprises services.
Whilst the enterprise is maintaining a standard of efficiency and data
protection as proceeded by the GDPR by the European Commission, there
are also inquiries to be made regarding the validity of the claim of data
destruction as past it’s efficiency stage within the specific establishment
and the validity of use of certain data (Starbucks.com. 2021). It is noted
several times through the text that the host of the services is forwarding
information passed on to third parties, in par with efficiency, performance or
for consumerism measures. However, my perspective lies within the belief
that if the enterprise would want to be completely transparent with their
intentions, there should be a disclosure on the service main page that
explicitly details the parties being provided with the information,

differentiated from the cookie permission slide and from the rest of the
permission slide, as so the users recognize where their information is being
provided to, so that they in turn may objectify if they so please. Specifically,
it seems that the notice of third parties is diverted into the permission
notice, in a very subtle way as so to seem that the users are being notified,
however, as to correctly handle the notification of users, there must be an
interactive feature which makes it noted if the user has noticed this
information (Starbucks.com. 2021). This may be achieved either through a
sliding interactive motion with a highlighted verse or a differentiated notice
for the specific issue in relation to the other notices. Thus, through this
process gaining certainty in regard to the user’s active notification and
inherently, their understanding of procedural matters. In contrast to this,
there is a motion for inquiry by users, of which the enterprise is legally
obligated to answer. This motion is acquired through actively submitting a
request of an inquiry for information or for notable questions one may have.
However, there is a subtle element of knowledge for the practice of this
notion, as there is an underlying complication to gaining access to this
interaction, as it requires some technologically savvy calibration on the site
in order to locate the feature, this highlights a gap in the way one must
acquire information. This gap is signified by technological knowledge and
as such, my suggestion illuminates the bridging of this gap, as to
additionally hire a live chat support group, in order to achieve the
completion of this process by a user whose knowledge doesn’t allow for the
completion of this process on an individual spectrum. 
In relation to the validation of the above claims, amongst various data
breaches that transpired within the company, the magnitude of the
importance of data security was felt recently, in the usage of data that was
leaked from an employee’s computer, due to it being stolen. The interface
allowed the thief unauthorized access of over 60,000 users, providing a
data breach of which valuable information was exposed and as such the
enterprise was sued for damages. Along with various data breaches
concerning the account services of which data is stored. As noted, the
casualty of being depreciated of valuable information, such as social
security numbers, IP addresses and addresses of residents or mailing
addresses , equated to a large issue for the company. Given the various
information provided above, it is inherent to note that the external access
that led to this specific data breach, could have been avoided by validating
data systems to collaborate with each other as to produce a two-factor
authentication verification system as to retrieve company stored
data (Varshney, S., Munjal, D., Bhattacharya, O., Saboo, S. and Aggarwal, N., 2020). Secondly,
as per this specific occasion, it becomes apparent that information stored
on a computer hard drive with no additional security, is a threat to data
security. The ideal preventive measure in regards to data security and
device protection, is the practice of asset inventory, as to produce a greater

understanding of the hardware and software assets in one’s
possession (Varshney, S., Munjal, D., Bhattacharya, O., Saboo, S. and
Aggarwal, N., 2020). This practice comes adjacent to understanding a
company’s security posture. As such, producing vulnerabilities and listing
them as to produce ways to combat them. Specifically, the reliance on
endpoint protection is an integral part of data security, as to avoid data
breaches. In adjacence to this, the prevention of a data breach can be
achieved by preventing the creation of unified data protection policies
across all servers, endpoints, and networks and, a well formatted and
comprehensive endpoint solution as to use encryption to prevent data loss
and leakage (Cheng, L., Liu, F. and Yao, D., 2017). This partnered with
knowledgeable data controllers and a mindful unit of staff, on alert for a
possible hinderance on the data systems in place and elevate the data
protection schemes in place within the company (Cheng, L., Liu, F. and
Yao, D., 2017).

                                            <h4>Transportation in the island of Wales, in regards to recent advancements in transportation

methods has provided an overall pleasant experience amongst the citizens of the area

(Welsh Government, 2014. National Survey for Wales, 2013-14 - Transport. Wales: Wales
Government, p.table 1-14).
This has occurred as a product of the recent technological growth (Kaffash, S., Nguyen, A.T.
and Zhu, J., 2021; Gohar, A. and Nencioni, G., 2021) . As these developments occur, citizens are
called to choose the most adventitious option. In regards to various disadvantages certain
citizens face, it is apparent that a portion of the populace in use of transportation methods
are not satisfied with their means of transportation, whilst others presume satisfied with their
choice, due to certain advantages they may face in contrast to others. This event, showing
the gap of disadvantages and privilege amongst various citizens.
The duality of opinions regarding the transportation means within the area, is prevalent. The
optimization of transportation in relation to convenience and efficiency has been noted by the
citizens of the area of Whales, in their acknowledgment of the multitude of ways of
transportation. Adherently, the prevalence of distress amongst the citizens of the area in
regards to current issues, plagues the area of contrasting opinions (an Dongen, L.A., Frunt, L.
and Rajabalinejad, M., 2019).
Certain issues that plague the area, is the existence of numerous incidents of intoxicated
and reckless driving (Gogarty, C., 2022). Additionally, a crucial matter of distain amongst
current citizens, is the lack of staff on trains. This in retrospect, causes delays and impedes
the smooth and consistent operation of their routes. Furthermore, the availability of motor
vehicles within a household is an interchangeable value, due to various household financial
capacities. This variable is relevant to the outbreak of Covid, as the constant dismay
regarding the condition and the continuous measures being applied, has affected the use of
certain transportation means. Motivating owners of motor vehicles to abstain from use of
public transport and prefer the use of their private vehicles and the greater population to be
vigilant about travelling with public transportation. Additionally, the sore in fuel prices due to
the Covid outbreak and as to the recent events regarding national safety amid the war in
Ukraine, has also affected the use of certain means. This proving the catalyst for citizens to
be hesitant to use their own motor vehicles due to the increase of fuel prices and yet hesitant
to use public transportation due to the outbreak.

In regards to survey that has been conducted, being used as referenced above, it is shown
that almost all citizens of the area own and operate a car, with a contrast populace of 21 %,
that do not utilize a car for transportation (Welsh Government, 2014. National Survey for
Wales, 2013-14 - Transport. Wales: Wales Government, p.table 15.). Additionally, of those in
ownership of a car, the percentage of the participants in relation to gender than own a car, is
estimated as to both genders to be regarded above 75%. This, allowing an estimate of 20%
of each gender category of the participants, not in use of a car (Welsh Government,
2014. National Survey for Wales, 2013-14 - Transport. Wales: Wales Government, p.table 17.).
Furthermore, it is noted through the evidentiary claims of the survey, there is an immediate
correlation between an individual’s overall health and the existence of a long-term illness
and the accessibility of transportation. In my view, the correlation is evident, and these
variables are inter-related, due to the fact that individuals of overall good health with no
underlying long term conditions are more likely to access transportation with ease, as a
response to their individual health status and the prerequisites of travelling with any specific
mean of transportation. As such, stemming from the tables, it is evident that an individual

with use of a car is more likely to have access transportation with greater ease (Welsh
Government, 2014. National Survey for Wales, 2013-14 - Transport. Wales: Wales Government,
p.table 24-26.)..
Additionally, the majority of the populace asked in regards to if they feel safe in travelling in
public transportation, at nighttime hours, replied positively while a minority of 20% stated the
opposite.

In addition to the previously stated events, most surveyed, replied positively that they have
use of a car and thus prefer transportation with this means of transport in relation to others,
representing a decisive percentage of above 75% of the populace asked. Most with use of a
car, were estimated to be equally divided between both genders, with a differentiated 10%
as the male unit leads. Furthermore, factors such as age, economic stature, rural or urban
location and gender aren’t deemed as major deciphering factors in the ownership or usage
of a car, as per transportation means. The differentiating percentage is allocated at
approximately 10-15% on all of those categories, in the area of Wales. Differentiating factors
such as bad health, limiting long term illness, and households with a single pensioner are
less likely to use a car. Specifically, it is noted through the survey, that those in use of a car
are overall more satisfied with their life (Welsh Government, 2014. National Survey for Wales,
2013-14 - Transport. Wales: Wales Government, p.table 15-22.). The general consensus is that
most ages have similar levels of satisfaction with the transportation systems in place (Welsh
Government, 2014. National Survey for Wales, 2013-14 - Transport. Wales: Wales Government,
p.table 2,14.).

With regards to representation, I chose to represent the information given to my person
through the survey, with a class UML diagram, as to state relationships between the
categories presented to myself within the survey, as to also highlight operations and
attributes. Whilst also signifying the results of a quantitative and objective survey, involving a
large pool of information and individuals, in a simplistic and informative way. A difficulty
arose in presenting the various categories and specifications, of a multifaceted question. The
process inherently required specific steps to be automated, as to complete the objective
stated, which was the answer of the survey questions. This was achieved through the
completion of a survey, in a written text.

Essentially, I constructed the diagram with the premise of stating the subcategories dividing
each value table and the portrayal of relationships amongst each value table on the UML
diagram. I have attached the UML diagram in use of the current information system below:

In acquiring the data set, I established a process of which I was able to develop fundamental
ideas as to categorize individuals and information, whilst also adhering to certain criteria of
which was utilized to conduct this process. Firstly, my first line of action, was to process the
information as to understand my dataset. Consequently, drawing as such, conclusions,
which were cross-examined with external sources of information regarding current issues
and recent events. As such, inviting outside sources to complete the theoretical approach I
possessed regarding the matter, as to support claims regarding recent events. This action
did not relate to the visual portrayal of this dataset but rather the theoretical approach that is
included within this writing. The conclusions produced from the previous relayed action, were
the catalyst as to begin the following process of relating the dataset to visual interpretations.
These visual interpretations were pronounced as per the use of a UML diagram, I created.
Furthermore, the conclusions stemmed from a critical thinking perspective, adhering to
previously referenced information as to utilize in the diagram. This was achieved through my
interaction with the database information system, responsible for helping my person
construct the assignment’s UML diagram, lucid chart. By correlating the information, I was
able to draw parallels and antithesis, whilst formatting a visual portrayal of the database.
Furthermore, after acquiring this visual portrayal I continued in stating this portrayal, verbally,
as stated in this writing.
The information given to me involved the categorization of all inquiries. These categories
were products of a common question. As such, the attached subcategories were
implemented as dependent on the previous common core inquiry. The achievement of the
most accurate data representation method was the main agenda of this assignment.
Adherently, the visualization, analysis and therefore, creation of conclusions was of
adequate importance, as well. The utilization of data for the adequate presentation of an
image, was the primary focus of my assignment, whilst clarifying the elements at hand as to
claim a common trajectory.</h4>

In relation to the National Survey for Wales: Transport Dataset, conducted in the
year 2013 to 2014, certain conclusions and information are evident. Firstly, whilst
glancing at this document, the organizational interface becomes apparent. We can
distinguish that the survey is divided into 5 categories, of which are separated into
several subcategories. The first category is the overall satisfaction with state of
transport system in Wales, indicating that people who don’t use their private motor-
vehicles have tendencies to be more satisfied than their fellow citizens (Welsh
Government, 2013.table 2). In addition to this, the factor of gender isn’t a defining
factor as the percentages according to the sex of the candidates are quite similar
(Welsh Government, 2013. table 3). Additionally, it becomes evident that those with
high satisfaction in accordance to their lives, tend to be more satisfied with the
means of transportation. This fact adherently, defines the proportional relationship
between specific values, that of satisfaction with life and transportation means.
In continuum, the second category identified is that of the individuals in use of a
car. The majority of citizens answered that they use a car for their daily
transportation (79%) while the rest answered negatively. Additionally, the individuals
questioned with an active employment status, answered positively in most part, an
estimate of 90%, in regard to ownership of a car. Whilst only 66% of individuals with
an unemployed status, answered positively to the same query. This contrast is in
direct relation to the financial state of the participants. Adherently, through the ability
of the use of a car, certain amenities are provided at greater ease, such as the easier
access to the hospital and medical centers. This is in direct correlation to individuals
with illness, as it provides greater ease for transportation and greater satisfaction
with life to all the previous categories of individuals. Subsequently as can be easily
understood from the document, the citizen’s general health is improving as a general
idea, whilst adhering to certain observations, such as the adaption of ease of transfer
to GP surgery (Welsh Government, 2013. table 24). Adherently, minimizing the
constraints of long-term illness (Welsh Government, 2013. table 25, table 26), with a
marginal group of individuals having access to transportation.
It is noted additionally that, in disregard towards age range and most criteria, it is
apparent that most citizens are able to be transferred with ease to and from the GP
surgery (Welsh Government, 2013. table 24-30). The statistics are also concerned
with transportation to the hospital. In relation to this most citizens have ease with
transportation to the hospital, regarded at approximately 80% (Welsh Government,
2013. table 31-38). However, a contrast lies in concerns with the populace being
limited by illness (Welsh Government, 2013. table 33). A great ease in both
transportation to the GP surgery and the hospital is established by citizens in use of
a car, as a means of transportation. In regard to the previously mentioned category,
accordingly to table 35, the criteria of household type seems to not be regarded as a
decisive factor of difference for most citizens, with regards to transportation, in the
most part, sharing an accumulative percentage for above the fairly easy and easy
mark (72-86%).

With regards to safety, most citizens regard public transport as a viable option
after dark, abstaining from fear. This percentage is estimated to be approximately
80% and as such provides the image of trust amongst citizens, as the essence of
potential crime isn’t felt, as noted within this document (Welsh Government, 2013.
table 39-42). The estimate is consistent of a vaster majority of men, however there is
a populace of women with common sentiments, as noted in table 41. However, a
crucial matter of deviance is regarded to be age in the feeling of felt amongst
citizens, as age marks the deterioration of physical integrity for the individual.
In addition to the aforementioned information regarding these graphs, it is
important to note the process undertaken in affirming the gathering of this
information. This process allocated precisely through the preprocessing steps that
have transpired, as to transform raw data into an understandable format. These
steps can be defined as data cleaning, data integration, data reduction and data
transformation.
As to define these steps is to provide a logical paradigm as to understand the
process involved behind the image of a logical sequence of events or otherwise a
graph. More specifically, data cleaning can be defined as the process of removing
the incorrect, incomplete, and inaccurate data, replacing missing values as needed.
Furthermore, this step is categorized into two subcategories, that of handling missing
values and noisy data (inconsistent/error data). This step was not necessary in the
formation of logical sequences and conclusions from the survey, as the survey didn’t
include missing values. However, in contrast, there was a presence of unreliable
data within the survey as indicated by the blue colored squares, enveloping the data
projected.
By using the binning method, the ability to store data in bin type of categorization is
actualized. Replacing the data selected, the retrieval of the mean, median or
boundary value was implemented. Then after, by use of the clustering method, the
grouping of similar data items commenced excluding the most irrelevant values, as
to create a commonality. In adherence to this, the later formatted data integration
method was used. In relevance to this, data integration allows the combination of
data to formulate a single dataset. Basically, by implementing chosen data from
certain tables, encoding analysis by my person, allowed the encompassing of an
adherent process to group the necessary heterogeneous data given, in order to
represent the data in a simplified manner as for the easier perception of its content.
Additionally, due to the immense amount of data presented within the survey, the
data reduction method was allocated as the term able to consolidate the data results.
This method allowed for the reduction of volume of the data for the adherence of a
prevalence of commonality, allowing for a more concise and clear analysis.
In substance, the last method used in concluding the transaction of a conclusion
based on the results granted by the survey, can be defined as the data
transformation method. The enabling of the transformation of the data into a more
suitable form, consistent with data mining, allowed for a follow up process to
transpire, after the initialization of this method. This allowed for the grouping of raw
value and the subsequent replacement of interval levels, applying discretization

which is representative of the data transformation method, applying added criteria as
a way of handling information as to obtain a relevant form.
Furthermore, the subsequent utilization of data analysis methods, led to quantitative
data analysis and the use of descriptive statistics. In relevance to its definition,
quantitative data analysis can be defined as the analysis of means as product of
number-based variants while descriptive statistics focuses on describing the
contents of a sample. In relevance to the populace being examined, the ability is
formed to create a representative sample. The definition of this term, is in turn
subject to alteration by the ability to calculate the mean and lower/upper contribution
intervals, resulting in the representation of various conclusions.
It is significant to highlight the inferential statistic method, as an integral part of the
survey examination. The use of the method allowing for the executions of predictions
regarding a populace. Specifically, by use of the ANOVA method, analyzation of
variance comparing the means of various groups (Welsh Government, 2013. table 1-
table 14), the accurateness of the sample measure is granted. Furthermore,
correlation analysis is adherently a useful tool simultaneously, granting the
opportunity to assess the relationship between two variables. Granting the ability to
distinguish the correlation of those items. This allowing for the direct investigation of
their potential proportional or inverse analogues values. In coherence to this,
regression analysis, shares similarity with this previously distinguished method,
whilst maintaining a difference of attempting to understand whether one variable
affects the other variable or whether it is simply a random event influenced by an
exogenous factor. These statistical methods proved integral for the extraction of
                                                certain observations and results.</h4>

Most certainly as perceived within the graphs, there is a gap between financial
statures with employed individuals being able to afford obtaining a car and those
which were unable. Uncertainty to be able to afford a commodity to enhance an
individual’s quality of life, may intervene in the satisfaction felt in regard to their life,
which is also noticed within the graphs.
Furthermore, the gap between individuals in use of a car with and without a limiting
illness, is apparent but not significant. The individuals in use of a car, having a
limiting illness are noted to be a lesser percentage that those without, maintaining a
differentiating gap of 10%. This in relation to limiting illnesses, shows that in
significance to one’s motor skills and limitations due to illness, certain obstacles arise
in purchasing a vehicle.</h4>
                                                    <h4>Additionally, it is noted, that employment is an indicative factor in the possession of
a car. This graph highlights the gap of acquiring possessions in relation to wealth
and financial stability, as for most household the possession of a job is interrelated
with the possession of a car. On par with this notion, is the discrepancy amongst
households regarding financial statures, as certain households may not need the
income due to wealth or in antithesis with this, some may use the vehicles of other
members of the household, irrelevantly to their employment status. This significant
difference may be altered significantly if the survey was to be aimed at vehicle
ownership.</h4>
                                                    
                                                    <h4>With regards to the transportation of individuals to and from GP surgery, it is
important to note that although most individuals with limiting illnesses or not, have
general ease in using transportation for this event, it is noted that as general health
stats and level of ease experienced in using transportation, have a proportional
correlation. This phenomenon highlights the difficulty experienced by individuals with
impaired health to use transportation, as is noted in various industries as which ill
people struggle to achieve aspirations due to the complications of their health
conditions. Noting that limiting illnesses are not defined as physical ailments that
cannot be managed, as per certain ailments. Lastly, it is noted within the graphs, that
age isn’t a largely discriminatory factor with regards to this survey, travelling after
dark and during the day with contrast to general health, as it is most likely that
individuals suffering with a lesser general health with suffer consequences towards
their travel and individuals of generally old age as due to be scared of the hours of
the night due to possible crime, as their ability to defend themselves in both cases
are impaired due to the constraints each situation faced.</h4>
                                                <h4>There are multiple solutions to each situation presented above. Consequentially,
solutions that inspire change and have a meticulous transaction are those that prove
to be of optimum result. Firstly, in understanding the information portrayed above,
deciphering factors of the survey seem to be general health, employment status and
the use of a car. Employment deems to be valued as a viable means to obtaining
certain items, as to improve overall life satisfaction. Adherently, the financial stature

obtaining greater life satisfaction. Additionally, an individual’s health seems to qualify

for an obstacle in using transportation and interrelated in one’s general satisfaction
with the transportation system.</h4>
                                                    <h4>As to provide solutions to these hinderances in the transportation system, it becomes
apparent that transportation vehicles must be awarded to individuals with limiting
illnesses as an aid for their ailments as to guarantee successful and safe
transportation, as followed by the implementation of aided movement in facilities of
transportation, such as buses and trains. Additionally, parking slots for individuals
with impaired mobility or limiting illness must be implemented as to guarantee
greater satisfaction with the overall transportation system within the community of
Wales. Lastly, there should be an implemented way of greater travel means from GP
surgery or hospital for those with impaired abilities due to illness or general health,
including those of greater age, as to greater accommodate them. Specifically, there
should be an insurance of transportation offered as an aid from the government,
which can be accessed with a specific aid.</h4>

animosity. Additionally, the current political climate has suggested the general
skepticism of the rights of limited individuals, replacing the previous admiration and
acceptance of these individuals, this general idea promoting difficult implementation
of systems that aid these individuals.

											<h4>Unit 1 (Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management):</h4>
											<p>Discussion Topic: Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), 
											in the context of the article by Huxley et al (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, 
											risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.</p>
											
<p>During the procedure of analyzing large amounts of data, usually we face many difficulties and challenges.
Processing large data sets can be very time consuming in our effort to draw the right conclusions and results. In
addition to this, the data collection sometimes can be highly constrained or highly delayed. Furthermore,
circumstances that data is sent from low latency environments by thousands of devices, make it necessary to
process at a rapid pace the data. In fact, that is the reason why proper design for the analytical procedure is
necessary to effectively manage these situations.
Furthermore, most of the times processing large quantities of data can be very challenging regarding the cost
required. In detail, a high-performance processing can be very costly mainly due to the high-power bills. However,
although low performance processing can be a good way to conserve energy usually it doesn't correspond to the
demand of the big data analysis. Therefore, it is necessarily important to apply a new architecture model to satisfy
both sectors.
The processing of large amounts of data often comes up against limitations that are usually created by the
processing of personal data. We need to be sure that all data protection laws are respected during the data analysis
process. This can be extremely challenging regarding the processing of big data. Personal data must be provided
only for specified and legitimate purposes and not for further processing that does not correspond to these purposes.
Moreover, the analysis of large amounts of data is confronted with many risks. The sources of the data can often
be unreliable, giving us the wrong information. This has as effect in the extraction of results that do not correspond to
reality, thus producing incorrect data analysis and conclusions.
Besides, a proper management of big data give us the opportunity to progress in different sectors. This is because
accurate data analysis leads to accurate decision making. Due to this fact in many areas can be achieved
development, and lay a solid foundation for advancement in science, medicine, and business.</p>

Comments: This was the first individual work that enabled us to point out the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges 
	  in relation with the data collection process. After anally examining the Lecturecast and other literature, most relevant to the topic
	 ,I managed to contribute to the discussion as follows. Following the completion of this task, I received an immense amount of information 
	  regarding the data collection process (opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges) which will present to be a very significant skill 
	  for my career afterwards, as a data scientist in which I will have to be capable of retrieving, handling large quantities of data and managing 
	  to take the correct data-driven decisions.
	
	
	
<h4>Unit 2 (Introduction to Data Types and Formats):</h4>
<p> Assignment: Considering what you have now learned in Units 1 and 2, you should respond 
                to at least three of your peers’ contributions from the Collaborative Discussion 1. 
	        To guide you, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s page (Group/Teamwork).

<p> Comments: In exploring the obligations of my master’s degree, I was called to process information provided by my peers 
	      and submit specific notes as to promote their improvement in terms of the accuracy of their written work. 
	      Additionally, in relation to the promotion of the accuracy of their work, I inherently as a response to an assignment, 
	      formulated specific questions in order to promote the retrieval of missed information produced in their written work.
	      This specific occurrence served as the first time I attempted to interact with my peers in a written manner with previously
	      formulated content. It is important to mention that these individuals were chosen to be my teammates in a group project in 
	      the Units 6 and 11 within the module. Within the aforementioned process, I read the essays of my fellow peers, and after careful 
	      consideration of their work, I formulated replies in a manner that promoted the expression of my own thoughts as for the adjustment
	      of their content for their improvement of their written content, whilst also inherently producing questions as to allow for the 
	      clarification of certain aspects unexplored within their work.

<h4>Unit 3 (Data Collection and Storage):</h4>
											
<p>Assignment: In this third and final week of your first discussion, you should provide a summary post
	       based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of Units 1, 2 and 3. 
	       Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words.</p>
											
<p>As our society and our knowledge evolve, so does the way we can use data. Nowadays, the decisions of
organizations and companies are fully guided by large masses of data which are imported from different data
sources ,in order to be processed and analyzed for this purpose. The completion of this procedure , can be achieved
much more efficiently since technology and loT (internet of things) are progressing rapidly.
However, even with the rapid evolution of technology sometimes the processing and analysis of big data can be
very time-consuming and costly. Additionally, while storing our data we need to be sure that our data sources are
reliable and will lead us to the right conclusions and decisions, otherwise erroneous decisions may lead to disastrous
consequences. Furthermore, it is required that the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are fully respected
during the data collection, data storage and data analysis procedures. More precisely, data coming from various loT
devices, may contain some personal details which only certain people will be able to access. Missing and incomplete
data ,make the task of the specialist even more difficult ,since they have to keep in mind the appropriate
configuration of the data as well.
Therefore, it becomes necessary for a data scientist to take into consideration these challenges. Data needs to be
accessed timely, accurately, and efficiently. Data cleaning is a fundamental procedure which contributes in preparing
our database for processing and analysis. During this procedure, bad and irrelative data are being removed to
simplify our analysis process. At the same time, handling missing and incomplete data is a fundamental part of this
procedure which a data scientist should be aware.
Data is all around us in our everyday life. Hence, the correct harvesting and processing of data is of utmost
importance for modern companies. On the other hand, irresponsible data management can be disastrous and affect
the smooth operation of the business.</p>

Comments: Within the implications of enacting in unit 3, I was called to gather information from both units, one and two 
	  ,as to provide a summary post in regards to the posting of my initial post in unit 1 the feedback from my peers 
	  in unit 2 and lastly the implementation of the content provided in the previous and current units.
	  The objective of the specific assignment contributed to a well-rounded understanding of the matter at hand and 
	  as such gave me the material necessary to relay information about this topic.

<p> Comments: This specific unit obligated my person to complete the data management pipeline test, which was automatically marked with 
	      its completion.This test enabled us to notice certain weaknesses in the knowledge obtained by the collective student unit, 
	      with regards to individual testing in the Data Management Pipeline. A Data Management Pipeline is a way of transporting 
	      data from one place (the source) to a destination (such as a data warehouse). During this procedure, the data is transformed 
	      and optimized so that it can be used to draw subsequent conclusions. </p>

<h4>Unit 5 (Data Cleaning and Automating Data Collections):</h4>
<p> Comments: The implications of in acting with the materials given in unit 5, have been conditioned to be the practical application
	 of data cleaning, allocating python examples in accordance with data taken from household-level surveys carried out by UNICEF.
	 As per enacting within the 5th unit, it becomes apparent that the subject at hand is the practice of data cleaning. 
	 Data cleaning can be defined as the process by which we formulate our data in a dataset in such a way that we fix or remove each 
	 data that is incorrect, incomplete, remove duplicates and filter unwanted outliers as well. Additionally, this procedure ensures 
         that the dataset contains only accurate information. Therefore, this unit aided my person in expanding my knowledge in data cleaning 
         and comprehend how I can practically implement the data cleaning techniques using Python examples. </p>

<h5>Comments:</h5> 
<p> In this unit my person had the opportunity to be allocated in a unit regarding the project, 
allowing for my person to cooperate with Panagiotis and Tsitsi as to achieve the execution of this project. 
The project topic was to design and build a single logical database in an area of our preference. 
My responsibility was the first part of the project in which I manage to create the logical design 
of the database (data items/entities, attributes of the data items chosen, relationships and associations).
Apart from the knowledge gained regarding the project’s subject, the entity of my team was able to develop skills 
such as cooperation, communication, and organization. These values are regarded as the epitome of a well-trained 
and professional individual within the workplace, as such it is applicable to mention that these skills aid an 
individual to achieve success within a unit in the workplace. </p>

include very goodunderstanding in the relevant key areas of knowledge. The logical database design includes purpose
specifications and entity relationship definitions. The data managemnet pipeline discusses data sources,
processing, and destination. The database design normal forms are briefly indicated. The reference section
includes nine references which are cited to support arguments in various sections. Application of knowledge
and understanding The project redresses a practical case of designing a database for an integrated ticketing
system commissioned by a transport authority. Theoretical descriptions are linked to the practical
requirements as communicated by an authority's strategy document. The database design section could
have been more elaborate and meaningful. Criticality There was a satisfactory demonstration of critical
analysis with regards to linking theory and practice. This is particularly apparent in the section on data
management pipeline. The discussion could have been more focused, for example the data sources being
more specific on information systems access. Structure and Presentation (as detailed in the assessment
guidance) The word count is around 1000 +10% (excluding TOC and references), and hence within the limit.
The report structure follows the requirements as it includes three sections on logical design, critical
evaluation of the data pipeline, and database proposal. Although not affecting the word count, the ERD
diagram is included twice with the latter (in the data design section) being redundant and could have been
replaced with more elaborate explanations. The conclusions section is very short and seems to have been
included just for the sake of having a conclusion section.</p>

<h5>Comments:</h5>
<p>
In this unit we focused on constructing normalized tables and database build. 
More specifically, my person was given a table in un-normalized form, and after 
following specific steps which are shown in detail in the document, I managed to 
comply the table with the 3rd Normal Form (3 NF). In continuance with the completion 
of the first part of the task, I was able to proceed to the next process allocated 
within a series of procedures I needed to complete. This step was allocated to build 
a relational database system, with linked tables, enacting in the application of primary 
and foreign keys.This unit was imperative to my person gaining knowledge on certain 
procedures regarding normalized tables and database build. The integration of certain 
rules applying to the creation of normalized tables can be allocated below. This procedure 
is intendent to prevent anomalies(unexpected errors of the data ),as such insertion anomalies, 
deletion anomalies and modification anomalies. Additionally, it must be noted that the 
differentiation of both keys lies within the differentiation of their function. 
Primary key is one or more columns which offer uniqueness for every individual record in a 
table while a foreign key is a column in a table which refers to a column in a different 
table ensuring referential integrity.
	

<h3>Checklist:</h3>
<blockquote>
Specifically,a table which applies in 1st Normal Form (1 NF),2nd Normal Form (2 NF) and 3rd Normal Form(3 NF) 
should follow the specific objectives, respectively:

	
	
	
First Normal Form(1 NF):

-All rows must be unique (no duplicate rows)

-Each cell must only contain a single value (not a list)

-Each value should be non dividible(can’t be split out further)

	
	
	
	
Second Normal Form (2 NF):

-Follow the First Normal Form (1 NF) and

-All attributes (non-key columns) dependent on the key (no partial-dependency)
	
	
	
	
	
Third Normal Form (3 NF):

-Follow the Second Normal Form (2 NF) and

-Remove transitive dependencies between non-primary key columns.

<h4>Unit 8 (Compliance and Regulatory Framework for Managing Data):</h4>
 <p> Within the contect of an assignment bestowed to us, the <h5> Collaborative Discussion 2 </h5>, 
we were called to compare compliance laws, in regards to specific paramenters.

 <p> The parameters are these: In relation to the securing of personal data rule, with either similar compliance laws within your country of residence, or with the ICO in the UK.

It is important to note that ICO refers to this rule as ‘Security’ and you should discuss your findings in relation to the standards set out and the exemptions that exist:

‘The securing personal data principle of the GDPR: Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data…’ (ICO.org.uk). </p>


<h4> Answer to Assignment: Comparing Compliance Laws </h4>
<p>
GDPR are laws that restrict the freedom of companies in relation to how they can use and collect the personal data
of individuals. Therefore, firms must be able to reasonably foresee everything they do with the data, and accurately
apply the law ,since otherwise they may be imposed with large fines. Similarities and differences can be
distinguished in regards with the application of these principles between countries.
To be more precise, the equivalent GDPR applied in the UK is called UK GDPR, which is almost identical with the
EU GDP. In general, the core definitions and legal terminology as such personal data, rights of data subjects,
controller and processor remain the same. However, in their application, these two regulations, present some slight
differences. For instance, a remarkable difference is that the age of consent at which an individual is able to provide
his personal data is 13, unlike in the EU which is 16. In addition, UK GDPR, appears to focus particular emphasis on
sectors such as national security, intelligence services and immigrations, while these regions are outside of the
scope of the EU GDPR. The provisions of the EU GDPR have been incorporated directly into UK law as the UK
subsequent version of the GDPR, affirming the same security regulations with compliance provided to different
countries. As per the implications of transactions occurring within UK organizations in regard to transactions
transpiring with EU residents it is adherent that the processing of such domestic personal data, whilst offering goods
and services to, or monitoring the behavior of EU residents, is attributed to follow the guidelines of the EU GDPR.
Lastly and more specifically, security measure applied within the two countries are proven to be equivalent and are
applied under different authoritative bodies (UK and EU).
Therefore, at a time when the development of technology is becoming more apparent, the capacity of
organizations to encounter personal data is becoming easier. That makes the compliance with all General Data
Protection Regulations (GDPR) even more crucial. </p>

<h5>Comments:</h5>
<p>
The collaborative discussion allocated in Unit 8 required of the individuals in attendance of the module to 
compare the rules of EU GDPR vs UK GDPR. The implications of enacting within the exercises provided in unit 8 
allowed for the learning of new knowledge. Generally, in enacting within the material given within this unit 
my person was able to understand specific regulations regarding data and it’s use in certain areas. Generally,
the GDPR are legal regulations in relation to the data protection and privacy, so their application is crucial 
for each organization which handles data. Therefore, as a future data scientist who will work on a daily basis 
with data, the detailed knowledge of the principles is necessary. </p>
					       
					       
					       



<h3>Unit 9 (Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Models):</h3>
<h5> Within this module, I enacted in preparation for my seminars: </h5>
													

															<p>Most Python codes and datasets are provided in files included in the Kazil textbook’s repository (see Unit 2 and 4 Reading). 
																The main aim here is therefore not learning the Python programming language, but rather learning how Python may be used
																in data analysis.Complete an example with storing data in a relational database. The example uses SQLite and includes the 
																following parts: </p>
</h4>
															<p>
																→ Installing SQLite and setting a relational database with Python: See the section Setting Up Your Local Database with 
																Python on pages145-146 of the Kazil textbook. You are also able to use the SQL workspace in Codio.
																→ Saving the cleaned UNICEF dataset into the SQLite database: See pages 193-194 and refer to Unit 4 if necessary.</p>
																
															

															<h4>In relation to the new knowledge obtained, the Unit 9 was mainly conjured to involve the Database Management Systems (DBMS) and 
															study of data models. The DBMS are software systems which are used as a connection between an end-user and a database. Therefore, 
															DBMS give us the opportunity to interact with databases, including creating, reading, updating and deleting data in the database). 
															In addition to this, database models, is the way the database is implemented. They are divided into three categories:</h4>
					       
															        <p>
					                                                                                        →Hierarchical model (simpler relationship, easy to handle).
																→The network approach (more flexible, difficult to develop due to its complexity of the relationships among entities).</li>
																→The relational model (the most usual data model, useful for connecting related tables and viewing the data from different angles). 
																Subsequently, during the Unit 9 seminar preparation my person moved on to the more practical side of this topic, which is allocated
																as building a DBMS. In fact, I managed to install SQLite, which is defined as a programming language which is used for extracting 
																data from a database. In turn, I produced a relational database. This database is based on the relational model of data adhering 
																to Python programming. Lastly, I saved the cleaned UNICEF dataset into the SQLite database.</p>

														<h4> Assignment Details:</h4> 
														<p> As a team, evaluate the security requirements of an API of your choice and write a
														     brief security requirements specification which mitigates against any risks associated with the API for enabling
														     data sharing, scraping and connectivity between a program code written in Python and any of the following file

														<h4>
															Comments: In this unit we focused on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Essentially, API stands as the 
															          mediator of which two programs interconnect with each other. More specifically, as to define the 
															          acronyms standing within the name, it becomes apparent that the acronym of application refers to any 
															          software with a particular function and in contrast to this the acronym interface can be considered 
														                  as the connecting link between two applications. Lastly it is important to mention the acronym for 
															          the word programming alluding to the necessity of coding within this interactive system. Therefore, 
															          APIs are crucial in the normal function of applications, as they obtain data shared amongst other 
															          applications and execute predefined processes as to serve towards efficiency in both time and effort 
															          for the creator and for better calibration of many applications.The final part of executing the unit’s 
															          objectives was the execution of an assignment of which I was required to assess the security requirements 
															          of an API of my preference. Firstly, becoming acquainted with the security requirements and then following 
															          this action, providing certain precautionary measures to limit the risk of API as a way for data sharing, 
															          scraping and connectivity. </h4>

														<h4> Details Regarding the Assignment:</h4> 
														<p> 
														The second part of the assessment is an Executive Summary of the completed design and build of a logical
															database based on the project report your team submitted at the end of Unit 6. Ensure you take account of the feedback
															you have received for the Unit 6 submission. You are required to produce an Executive Summary that pulls together your 
															findings, recommendations and conclusions in a clear and unambiguous format. Your report should also review concepts 
															underlying database modelling and critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the relevant data models used in 
															your design and build. Your recommendations should take into account the legal and compliance requirements applicable 
															to the organisation. You will be submitting a report that informs your client of the outcomes of your analysis and 
															evaluation of your choice of data model highlighting strengths and limitations. </p>

														<h4> Comments: </h4>
														<p> 
															In Unit 11 we were required to submit an assessment. This assessment was produced, as per the finalization part of the 
															collective assessment performed in unit 6. As per this task, we were required to complete an executive summary regarding 
															the specific topic of the assignment within unit 6. The executive summary included our findings, recommendations, 
															conclusions, list of pros and cons of the relevant data models used in the submission in Unit 6. My person was responsible 
															for the part of the assignment which had to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the relevant data models used in our 
															design and build in Unit 6, and the creation of the renewed Entity-Relationship-Diagram based on our recommendations.
															The outcome of the second part of the project, which was allocated as the executive summary mentioned above, was much better 
															in terms of cooperation, since I was more familiarized with my teammates. We were able to operate as a team in a greater ease
															due to the familiarity between us and we were also able to conduct tasks with greater organization. The feeling of cooperation 
															and supportiveness was increased and as a result we encouraged each other to produce a better outcome and perform better on 
															the tasks at hand. These facts, in combination with the consideration of the feedback produced by the authoritative figure 
															minding our progress in Unit 6, allowed for the production of greater efficiency within the team. In addition to this, I 
															had the opportunity to notice the importance of values such as communication, cooperation and organization and better 
															instill them in my life as to support my everyday objectives in both a professional and personal level. </p>
														
														<h2>Reflections Regarding The Module</h2>
														<p>
															In remembrance of the process I faced during my personal enactment within the obligations of this module, 
															I can recount mostly positive experiences and knowledge earned. This occurred as per my personal enactment
															within group assignments and individual exercises that procured my personal development and improvement 
															of my skills. More specifically, during the module, we were able to enhance our knowledge in regard to 
															the different data extraction, exploration, cleaning, and modelling techniques, which undoubtedly is of 
															crucial importance as a future data scientist. Furthermore, in relevance to this, a more general objective 
															maintained regarding this topic, was obtaining a general idea on this topic. </p>
	
														<p>
															In regards to this, the collective student unit had the opportunity to get familiarized with the 
															Data Management Pipeline procedure. As to better define this procedure, it is the process of transporting 
															data from one original location (the source) to a destination (such as a data warehouse). During this process,
															the data is transformed and optimized so that it can be used to draw subsequent conclusions. 
															Adherently there are steps that belong to this procedure, which can be allocated as the capturing of raw data,
															data cleaning, data integration, database design, data analysis and data visualization. 
															As previously mentioned, during the module we had the opportunity to enhance our skills in regards with 
															the data cleaning procedure. Data cleaning can be defined as the process, by which we formulate our data 
															in a dataset in such a way that we fix or remove each data that is incorrect, 
															incomplete, remove duplicates and filter unwanted outliers as well. Therefore, it ensures that the dataset 
															contains only accurate information. In addition to this, we had the opportunity to become familiarized with 
															the Database Management Systems (DBMS) and study of data models. The DBMS are software systems which are 
															used as a connection between an end-user and a database. Therefore, DBMS grants us with the ability to 
															interact with databases, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in the database. 
															In contrast, database model, is the way the database is implemented, and they are divided into three 
															distinct categories which are mentioned to be Hierarchical model, the network approach and the relational 
															model which is the most common of the three data models stated previously. </p>
														
														
														<p>
															As such, it is adherent to say that a data scientist with a great understanding of knowledge 
															adherent to his field must adapt to handling data and using this information and tools as he sees fit. 

															In relevance to activities being procreated by team efforts, there were many objectives referring to this effort. 
															In accordance with this notion, the use of cooperation, adherence to the opinions of others after debate 
															and the application of a verified answer on all parties allowed for the team to progress in a joint and agreed 
															progression. <p>
														
														
														<p>											
															In addition to this, amongst the many objectives appointed to my team during the enactment of our persons in this 
															module, the necessity for participation in group projects and assignments was prevalent as to produce 
															a better outcome and for the prevalence of the group’s effort. In adjacence to this, due to the 
															familiarization of the team members amongst each other, an environment was set as for the better 
															progression of joint efforts such as projects whilst also adhering to each person’s better abilities, 
															as to provide the adequate roles to each party as perceived amongst these noted abilities. This notion, 
															adhering to the greater outcome of the project due to the use of individuals towards their area of 
															expertise as to better set the prerequisites for a perfect scenario including time efficiency, 
															greater cooperation, and organization. As per the objectives that my team was obligated to complete,
															I can confirm that my personal enactment was vital to the completion of these previously mentioned 
															objectives. Specifically speaking, my enactment, for the production of the project my team was 
															responsible of producing, was of newfound experience for my person. The objective presented to our 
															team was the creation of a database system in accordance with a transportation system that was acting 
															in real time, as such on par with my individual efforts an additional team effort, entailed the 
															application of logical ideas produced by my team members and myself, to reenact interactions of everyday 
															users and project possible improvements for the application of better terms of use for certain items.
															In regard to the objectives performed within my involvement in assignments regarded towards individual
															and group enactment, I feel like I was able to achieve personal growth. </p>
														<p>
															As such I can inherently perceive my better understanding of certain practices involving the better cooperation 
															between teammates and additionally, I can further understand the magnitude of development procured within my person 
															as a return for my implications in the aforementioned processes and procedures. More specifically I can 
															notice that certain values have been ingrained in my person especially towards my enactment with 
															others in a team setting, such as cooperation and respect for the opinion of others. As well as 
															these values I have also noticed that my individual adopted certain traits. These traits can be defined
															as becoming a better listener enabling my person to adhere to certain objectives allowing for others 
															to involve themselves within a creative process that I am also involved. More specifically, a catalyst
															for my progressive change as an individual can be determined to be the objectives placed within this module
															and as such can be attributed more specifically to team projects.  </p>
														<p>
															Lastly, I desire to describe the overall experience during the module as successful, 
															since I have successfully captured the main objectives of the module and developed a greater understanding 
															towards the sector of data science. </p>

<h4>
Read the Schwab (2016) article from World Economic Forum and discuss the impact of industry 4.0 on the sector in which you are involved or interested.</h4>

                                            <h4><u>Instructions:</u>Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.Review lecturecast 1 and read papers provided in the references list.Go to the discussion forum and create an initial post of your contribution to the discussion.</h4>
                                            
                    <h4><u>Initial post by Constantinos Kyriacou</u></h4>
<h4>
 In the present time we are experiencing an unprecedented technological development in which humanity is called upon to adapt, since it radically affects how people live, work and relate to one another (Scwab,2016). The rapid developments impact data science as well, which is a field that has come to the foreground and has evolved significantly during the last two decades.</h4>
<h4>
   In essence, the 4th industrial revolution focusses on the automation and control of the behavior of machines having as a guiding tool the data (Coleman, 2019). Machines can be programmed to be smart enough so that they can perform as a human without any supervision. Therefore, although the requirements of a data scientist rises significantly as the amount of data increases exponentially over time(Chowell & Viboud,2016), this evolution enabled them to handle data with greater ease and less delay(Schwab,2016).</h4>
<h4>
  Nevertheless, the misapplication of the development of technology can be disastrous in some cases. Nearly 30 years ago, a healthcare service company called FoxMeyer was one of the most profitable drug wholesalers in the United States(Hamrouni,2017). Due to the intense competition, there was a demand for a solution that could undertake complicated supply decisions while keeping costs comparatively low. They considered that the solution to the problem would be provided using an ERP for receiving real time data and automate processes. Τhis turned out to be fatal since the total cost which exceeded 100 millions dollars for the implementation of ERP and the mismanagement led to bankruptcy a few months later.</h4>
<h4>
  Consequently, the demand for medicines from the remaining companies had increased significantly, which led to an increase in prices. Τhis event certainly dissatisfied customers who were obliged to overpay for essential health products. Αs was to be expected ,after this incident the cost of defamation was huge, fact which discouraged FoxMeyer for total restructuring.</h4>
<h4>
  Therefore, the technological ignition is a phenomenon that has been observed to a greater extent in recent years and can bring about beneficial results in many industries.

Hello Constantinos,</h4>

<h4>
I appreciate your thought-provoking post that sheds light on the impact of technological advancements and their potential consequences. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has ushered in significant changes in various aspects of human life, reshaping our lifestyles, work environments, and social interactions (Schwab, 2016). Notably, the field of data science has experienced remarkable growth and prominence during this transformative era.</h4>

<h4>
At the core of this revolution lies the automation and control of machine behavior through the utilization of data (Coleman, 2019). Machines have now reached a level of sophistication where they can mimic human intelligence without constant supervision, empowering data scientists to efficiently handle vast volumes of data (Schwab, 2016). However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the demand for skilled data scientists has risen in parallel with the exponential growth of data (Chowell & Viboud, 2016).</h4>

<h4>    
Your mention of FoxMeyer, a healthcare service company, serves as a cautionary tale highlighting the potential disastrous consequences of misapplying technology (Hamrouni, 2017). Their ill-fated implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system resulted in bankruptcy due to mismanagement and excessive costs. As a consequence, the availability and pricing of essential health products were adversely affected, leading to customer dissatisfaction and significant damage to the company's reputation.</h4>
    
<h4>
I would like to delve deeper into the topic of responsible technological implementation and hear your opinion. How do you think organizations can strike a balance between harnessing the benefits of technology and mitigating the risks associated with misapplication? Are there specific measures or strategies that you believe should be in place to ensure responsible and effective use of technology? Your insights on these matters would be greatly appreciated.</h4>
    
<h4>
I am eager to participate in this engaging discussion and gain valuable insights from your perspective.</h4>

Hello Konstantine,</h4>

<h4>                                                
This is a fascinating post for a category of systems that nearly 70% of large organizations use (Sage Software Solutions Pvt Ltd, 2023). Even more interesting is that this failure goes back to before the concept of Revolution 4.0.</h4>
<h4>
ERP systems have been fully involved and incorporated with revolution 4.0 by using big data, many different data sources, cloud computing and IoTs (Hanson, 2020). Despite the 'more mature' ERP era, the ERP failure, or better, the implementation failure of FoxMeyer, is not eliminated nowadays, with "67% of distributors and manufacturers reporting the ERP implementation as successful or very successful" (Biel, 2022), thus leaving 33% with unsuccessful implementation projects (including somewhat successful).</h4>
<h4>
Digging into the reasons for the failure of FoxMeyer's implementation, we can quickly notice that the main points of failure revolve around self-evident (nowadays) general IT project points of failure for which project managers plan around. Those generic points of failure are the poor selection of software, lack of appropriate stakeholder involvement and support (including end-users) and contingency planning (fall-back plans) as well as setting unrealistic expectations (Scott, 2003).</h4>
<h4>
From all the above, it becomes apparent that the human element (project managers, business analysts and stakeholders in general) may be decisive about a project's success or failure regardless of technological advancement and 'smart' systems. Evolution 4.0 is not about the machines replacing humans but rather about human-machine cohabitation (Villanneau, 2022).</h4>

                                                <h4><u>Initial Post by Piotr Sieminski</u></h4>
<h4>
The topics discussed in Schwab's (2017) book on the fourth industrial revolution concern a sector I am involved in professionally - that is Big Data. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence cannot be created or work or exist or provide any value without the data that fuels them. It is fair to say that the significant advancements in ML and AI fields are made available thanks to the exponential increase in the data we collect globally, as humanity (Anon, 2022).</h4>

<h4>
The availability of big data enables organisations to operate and scale more efficiently. With the increased reliance on data there is a growing risk of an incident with serious repercussions, should the data become unavailable, for whatever reason.</h4>

<h4>
This brings me to a specific incident where information systems failed: the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack (Julia Carrie Wong and Solon, 2017). This attack focused on encrypting organisations’ data and demanding a ransom in order for them to regain access. For private businesses this had widespread consequences that affected business continuity and resulted in monetary losses. Unfortunately also government organisations have been a target, with the UK’s NHS patients suffering, arguably, the most having thousands of their appointments cancelled and others having experienced disrupted patient care. This shows how important and crucial asset data is. By restricting access to it, malicious actors have caused pain and suffering - for NHS’s patients, monetary loss for businesses, disrupted usage of products of many companies (arguably the lowest level impact) by their customers and caused a significant reputational cost to all of the organisations affected. The failure of the systems that were hacked lays within the lack of proper cyber security measures that should have prevented attackers from gaining access to the data in the first place.</h4>

<h4>
This example clearly proves that with great power, that big data gives us, huge responsibility comes. I like to think about it in a similar way one could think about household finances. The lower the number of streams of income, the higher reliance factor is associated with every single source of income, the higher risk of defaulting on household payments. If we, as humanity, continuously increase reliance on data and information systems - we must be prepared for an increased risk of “defaulting” on the delivery promised by these information systems.</h4>

<h4>First of all, I want to mention that the overall result and structure of the work delighted me
to a considerable extent. Ι particularly enjoyed the introduction of your assignment ,where It
was highlighted that it is taken advantage of the massive amount of data which is used as
the motive engine that contributes in advancing the fields of machine learning and artificial
intelligence(Sieminski,2023). In addition to that I find crucial your reference to the fact that
increasing reliance on data leads to greater responsibility to protect them, since the
consequences in the case of a malicious action by individuals who may have personal
interests, would be catastrophic.</h4>
                                                
<h4>However some consequences when describing the incident in relevance to the WannaCry
ransomware attack in 2017 are not clear to my mind. For example, in what way the
aforementioned incident affected UK’s NHS patients and what was the reason as regards
the cancelled appointments? Furthermore, what was the ensuing consequence in relevance
to the damaged reputation of the organisations affected?</h4>

<h4>
It is clear that, although there are proponents of Industry 4.0 and the benefits it might bring, there are some who equally express concern about its impacts on our economies and our societies, more generally (Schwab, 2016).</h4>

<h4>While its benefits are normally cited in terms of the efficiencies it will deliver in our daily lives, for example in the ordering and purchasing of goods and services, Schwab (2016) explains that gains will also be made by means of the increased value that new technology will bring to existing goods and services. </h4>

<h4>In the field of medical devices, the advent of Industry 4.0 is leading to advancements in the areas of, e.g., digitisation, ergonomics and augmented reality (Popov et al, 2022).</h4>

<h4>However, there are notable concerns about advancements in technology as an enabler for greater opportunity to carry out cyberattacks: </h4>

<h4>One example of an incident in the field of medical devices (Critical Software) demonstrates how reliance on a system that has the capability of storing and transmitting patient and drug library data could lead to significant patient risk. In this case, a manufacturer was obliged to mitigate for this potential failure to avoid a recall of the device:</h4>

<h4>In September 2022, Baxter Medical published an alert relating to two of its infusion pumps, in which multiple vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive data, perform a man-in-the-middle attack, or cause a denial-of-service condition in the device. As a temporary mitigation, users were recommended to reset network settings, delete the drug library and clear the history log before decommissioning the device (NHS Digital, 2022). </h4>

<h4>This incident is an example of how vulnerabilities in connected systems can be exploited by bad actors and why cybersecurity will be an ever-increasing focus of medical device manufacturers with the advent of Industry 4.0.</h4>

highlighted both the benefits that the constant advancement of technology will bring
about as well as some concerns in regards with the malicious usage of the industrial

                                            <h4><u>Summary Post by Constantinos Kyriacou</u></h4>

  <h4>Αs already noted in my initial post, in some circumstances the development of technology when misused , may lead to disastrous consequences. Ιn the light of the incident that took place nearly 30 years ago at Foxmeyer (Hamrouni,2017) and in combination with the concerns raised within my fellow student's reply, this report will have as its main purpose to delve deeper into the risk mitigation by companies in relevance to the area of technology.</h4>

  <h4>Τhe above-mentioned issue is a current topic which should be addressed carefully and responsibly. Ιnitially in the case where a company uses software programmes the suitable training of the endpoint users is essential. This occurs due to the fact that endpoints are devices which are vulnerable to malicious software attacks by external users who desire to break into the system. In addition to that, the presence of a system administrator who supervises access to the system by controlling the endpoints is critical. As a result, this will significantly reduce any malicious access to the companies' systems (Shannon,2021).</h4>

  <h4>In addition to that, technology is a constantly evolving field. Considering the progress that has been made in this area over the last decades, it is difficult to foresee the upcoming evolutions in the following years (Noles,N.D). Therefore, the software programs must be constantly updated to be able to respond as regards to the evolving risks due to the technological advancement. Having this in mind, we should not overlook the fact that the company’s staff will need to be retrained to meet the evolutionary challenges that occur over time. This will go a long way to ensuring that all tasks are suitably implemented.</h4>

                                                <h4>To summarize, there is no doubt that technological development has resulted in the advancement of the quality of life at different levels. We are now able to perform tasks that some years ago seemed impossible. Ηowever, mismanagement and lack of knowledge in this area can cause disastrous results for a company. Τhus, our behavior in the context of workplace must be in line with responsibility and certainty.</h4>

<h4><u>Assignment Brief:</u> Airbnb business analysis using data science approach
                                            </h4>
<h4><u>Background:</u>Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalised ways of experiencing the world. The Airbnb dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv) along with its description can be accessed through the Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019, which includes all needed information about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.<h/4>
<h4>
This assignment is aimed at assessing your ability to pose interesting questions relevant to Airbnb business, process the data using the key steps of big data analytics, such as, data pre-processing, analysing, and eventually preparing an analytical report. In order for your analysis to be compelling, it must address a substantive issue rather than a trivial one.<h/4>
                                                <h4><strong><u>TASK 1 </u>(Business analytic question)</strong></h4>

<h4>Propose an interesting business analytic question that can be answered using the given Airbnb dataset. The proposed question should be useful for Airbnb. An example question could be: is there any noticeable difference in bookings among different areas and what could be the reasons for it?</h4>

<h4><strong><u>TASK 2</u> (Data analysis)</strong></h4>

<h4>In this task, use your data analytics skills to answer the question posed in the Task 1. Depending upon your chosen question, you will typically have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data pre-processing, statistics-based data analysis, data visualisation and use unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering).</h4>

<h4><strong><u>TASK 3</u> (Analytical report)</strong></h4>
 <h4>
In this task, you are expected to prepare an analytical report, which can easily be interpreted by the executive board members of the Airbnb. There is no fixed specification for this report but in general, it must contain an adequate number of visualisation charts/graphs with a lucid description. The total number of pages of the analytical report must not exceed beyond 2 pages (1000 words equivalent).</h4>
<h4>
<strong><u>Please note:</u></strong> You are required to submit your Python code as an appendix for this assessment. Other appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete, and concise, without the appendices. They should only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.</h4>

<h4>Read/listen to the article by Hutson (2021) in Nature on Robo-writers. This week, post your thoughts on the risks and benefits of the use AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing.</h4>
<h4>
You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.).</h4>
                                                <h4><strong><u>Intial Post by Konstantinos Kyriacou</u></strong></h4>
                                                <h4>

Artificial intelligence is the field of science which seeks to develop computer systems and machines which can reason, learn and act in a manner of a human being reasoning (Burns & Laskowski ,2023). Artificial intelligence is utilized most in financial services as such fraud detection and algorithmic trading, insurance for AI-Powered Underwriting and Claims Processing, healthcare for precision medicine and algorithms and in many other cases as well (Hastings, 2022). For this task purpose we will focus our discussion as regards the risks and benefits of utilizing Artificial Intelligence writing.</h4>
<h4>
Beginning from the pros of Artificial Intelligence writing tools, the most basic element is the efficiency and speed of writing (Hare, 2022). The content is generated significantly faster than human writers and therefore valuable time is saved. In addition to that, the cost using Artificial Intelligence writing tools is much less in comparison with a human writer when developing a brief content. This happens since AI writing tools utilize a monthly subscription for limited word count with prices ranging from about 100 dollars per month. Finally, many AI tools contribute to providing information as regards the content and key elements of a subject examined. Consequently, this is beneficial in case which the human writer is not an expert on the subject examined.</h4>
<h4>
However, several negative effects occur when utilizing Artificial Intelligence tools. To be more precise, AI is based on data analysis and algorithms for producing content. Consequently, sometimes the quality of the content might not be at the expected level it should be due to the occurrence of possible misuse of statistics. In addition to that sometimes when dealing with Artificial intelligence writing tools, the issue of plagiarism appears at very frequent intervals. Finally, creativity and originality are key elements which contribute to producing successful and enjoyable reading content. Nevertheless, Artificial Intelligence is not yet at the desired level of emotional intelligence and thus these key factors are missing from the context produced.</h4>
<h4>
On a general basis, artificial intelligence is a field of science which was developed to make the life of specialists easier (Maheshwari, 2023). Nevertheless, several disadvantages appear in relevance to specific sectors as mentioned above. Consequently, on some occasions, when dealing with human achievable tasks, specialists’ outcome is more qualitative and hence it is preferable instead of Artificial Intelligence.</h4>

                                                <h4>Hi Constantinos,</h4> 
<h4>
Thanks for the insight in the post, and oh yeah, I agree with this statement, "Artificial Intelligence writing tools cost much less than a human writer when developing brief content."</h4> 
<h4>
Content creation is crucial for online presence and attracting followers in the digital age. Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing offers efficiency and creativity. Experts predict that by 2023, AI-generated content will make up 46% of the web. Incorporating AI alongside human-written content appeals to a broader audience. (Stephanne,  2023).</h4> 
<h4>
Some key areas where AI tools shine include; data quality. AI tools can assist with grammar, spelling, and generating relevant content. Also, AI tools offer speed and efficiency, allowing writers to focus on other aspects of their business. Moreover, there are cost benefits, as AI writing tools can generate content at a lower cost than human writers, reducing overhead and eliminating the need for extensive training. AI writing tools can improve content quality, save time, and reduce organisational costs. (Stephanne,  2023).</h4> 
<h4>
But despite the potential of AI, there are still some aspects to writing that only a human can do. We all know that feeling when we read something written by an AI that is off or disconnected from our thoughts. AI cannot understand nuance, emotion, or context like humans. AI is only as good as its programming, and humans are much more complex than that. (okwrite, 2023).</h4>

                                                <h4><u>Initial Post by Samuel Adeniyi</u></h4>
<h4>
The advent of robot writers powered by artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked extensive discussions on the implications of their implementation in various fields, ranging from administrative tasks to creative writing. This post studies the risks and benefits of AI writers at different levels.</h4>
<h4>
Choi describes today's AI-powered language models as a brainless mouths. Hutson (2021), I find the statement by Chio intriguing because large language models are a semantic search process that is finetuned by prompting to improve the result your get from the model. Bad prompting equals terrible results.</h4>
<h4>
AI writers could bring numerous benefits to creative writing and administrative tasks. AI offers remarkable efficiency gains in data-driven content generation, such as being used to identify errors and inconsistencies in documents and reports. (Eppler, 2023). AI can be a creative catalyst by generating ideas, plot points, and dialogue, helping writers overcome creative blocks and explore new directions. It fosters a symbiotic relationship with writers, stimulating their imagination and creating more innovative and unique stories. (Sesame, 2021).</h4>
<h4>
Moreover, AI saves time and boosts productivity by automating tasks like proofreading, editing, and research. Allowing writers to focus on the more creative aspects of their work, manage their time effectively, and delve deeper into their stories. (Sesame, 2021).</h4>
<h4>
AI Writers also have significant drawbacks, including the risk of plagiarism, as AI relies on data analysis and algorithms. Many AI writer tools scrape and reword content from other websites or content the algorithms were trained on, which are also historical data from different sources. (Hare, 2022).</h4>
<h4>
And also, AI writers cannot provide expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness in most cases leading to misguided personality, tone and style of the human writer. This is where human writers dominate over the use of AI writers. (Mayer, 2023). </h4>
<h4>
To conclude, AI writers offer efficiency, language support, and creative inspiration benefits. However, concerns exist regarding quality, plagiarism, and ethics. Balancing automation and human creativity is essential. Ongoing research, ethical guidelines, and dialogue are crucial for the responsible integration of AI writers.</h4>

Hello Samuel,
Thank you for this interesting post.</h4>  
<h4>  
You have correctly mentioned several benefits and drawbacks within your initial post. My perception in relation to utilizing Artificial Intelligence in automation writing is in line with the content of your post, both benefits and concerns.</h4> 
<h4>  
I would like to focus on your point mentioning that automation in writing carries out tasks in a time interval in which it would be impossible for a human being to carry out the same task (Christensen,2023). For instance, poems can be written in just a few seconds for a given subject, a task which would require hours or even days for a poet so as to create rhyme. Yet another example constitutes the event when entire books can be written in a few minutes while the same task can be implemented within several months or even years for a writer.</h4> 
<h4>  
On the other hand, several drawbacks should be taken into consideration as correctly noted within your post. I would like to emphasize on a point that it is not highlighted enough . More specifically, using Artificial Intelligence for automation writing decreases significantly the cognitive level of writers, influencing their creativity and the quality of their thought process (Li et al.,2015).</h4> 
<h4>  
To summarise, as indicated within your post, Artificial Intelligence for automation writing can be both beneficial and harmful when been utilized. Consequently, individuals should be particularly careful and therefore balancing automation and human creativity is required (Adeniyi,2023). </h4>

<h4>
This post will be more of an opinionated piece rather than academically referenced throughout, since this is a topic I have given a lot of thought recently. </h4>
<h4>
While I am studying this field and am intending to pursue a further career in artificial intelligence, I definitely have some concerns regarding auto generated content. Perhaps even more so because I am now more aware of the capabilities and possibilities. However I believe that the potential is great, and that this technology can provide a lot of good when handled the right way.</h4>
<h4>
My main concerns lie when I am thinking about the next generation; the school system has to rethink their teaching methods now that the kids have these text generated “wisdoms” at the tip of their fingers. Student examinations would have to be modified in such a way that students can’t fully rely on text generation tools. Burrows (2023) has a few suggestions:</h4>

<h4>
-Task students to refer to thoughts and ideas from an author on specific pages of a book</h4>
<h4>
-Task students with in text citations </h4>
<h4>
-Task students to compare historic events with present occurrences (as of yet I don’t think there are any “realtime” chatbots that can provide information like this, but this will likely change in the future) </h4>


<h4>
I find these are really good solutions, and could even enhance the overall learning quality by guiding students to be specific. I further believe students can use text generation tools for inspiration, not everyone can personally generate ideas and establish thoughts as easily as others for example. They allow you to explore subjects in an easygoing back and forth conversation that can reach great depth. It can create a conversation of subjects and answers that might not be so easy to find in a search engine like Google - and perhaps even boost productivity this way. Of course, as Hutson (2021) mentioned as well, this information must be considered with caution since chatbot replies can often be plausible yet incorrect. </h4>
<h4>
Besides students, teachers can also use these tools to create lesson materials and quizzes. This will allow teachers to spend less time preparing for classes and more time for individual attention - leading to enhanced student experience. </h4>
<h4>
The other thing I have been concerned about, perhaps slightly off-topic but very relevant, is image generation. I am worried that the ease by which beautiful looking artwork and images can be created using tools such as Dall-E and Midjourney, will put young people off being creative. I can imagine that one might not see the point in spending 20 hours drawing something when Midjourney can generate it in seconds. I hope I am wrong here, as I value the creative industry deeply. </h4>
<h4>
In conclusion, it is important that measures will be put in place globally to use these tools to our advantage. With the right methods, I believe AI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney can be used to increase our creativity and productivity - but we have to proceed with care and caution. </h4>

<h4>Hello Astrid,</h4>
<h4>Thank you for this interesting post.</h4> 

<h4>Initially, I would like to agree with your perception that Artificial Intelligence writing is a field which can facilitate people’s lifestyles, since it has an outstanding capability in automated writing. In fact, this is the aim of the evolution of every aspect of technology, to improve the quality of life of society (Carkett & Macon-Cooney,2022). Some of these benefits are highlighted within your initial post and I completely agree with every point you have mentioned.</h4>

<h4>However, on a general basis technology can only be beneficial when utilized in moderation. This is the case in this field as well since the excessive use of automation can lead to several negative consequences in relevance to creative and innovative thinking (Li et al.,2015). This event influences mostly young children, whose cognitive level development is still in progress.</h4>
  
<h4>Consequently, as a general conclusion I consider that automating writing is a field which does not itself encapsulate negative consequences to society. The issue is always the manner in which this technological advancement is being utilized, as is the case with all technological advancements including Artificial Intelligence (Aly,2020). </h4>

 <h4><strong><u>Thoughts on the ethical and social implications of CNN technology</u></strong></h4>       
<h4>
Convolutional Neural Network technology is clearly a magnificent improvement within the artificial intelligence field. To be more precise it is mainly used for image or speech recognition (Lang,2021). However, there is still a long way to go until perfection since several times misidentifications have been identified. Consequently, we should be very careful in relevance to the sectors in which this advancement of technology is utilized.</h4>
<h4>For instance, police and security forces utilize this identification system in their attempt to identify criminals or terrorists(Wall,2019). However, since the mechanism is not at the expected levels of accuracy, most of the times it causes the dissatisfaction of innocent citizens who are wrongly identified as criminals. In fact, in the case of a mistaken identification of a terrorist it is very likely an innocent suspect to be killed in order to prevent any potential attack. However, this causes the indignation of the citizens since in many cases their privacy is violated, innocent individuals get in trouble or in the worst case innocent people lose their lives. It is a logical result, society to come out against this kind of unfair behavior and express their dissatisfaction.</h4>
<h4>However, Convolutional Neural Network could be beneficial for some other purposes. For instance facial recognition might be useful for keeping track of prisoners or preventing gang violence. Supporters of this technology claim that we cannot discern whether an advancement is beneficial or harmful for the society. This event is dependent on the manner in which the utilization of the owners will be carried out and for this event the inventors have no responsibility.</h4>
<h4>To summarize, giving my own perspective for this topic , Convolutional Neural Network should improve within the future so that it can offer more services in different areas. Until then , it’s application should be restricted so that it does not affect society in a negative manner. My belief is that within the next few years, artificial intelligence will improve in such a degree which almost everything will be accomplished by machines without human supervision.</h4>

       <h4><strong><u>Summary Post by Constantinos Kyriacou</u></strong></h4>
        <h4>To summarize, I would describe the above collaborative discussion valuable for the understanding of the Artificial intelligence field in automation, referring to both the benefits and drawbacks of this aspect. It consists of an effective way for exchanging thoughts with my peers and learning from each other.</h4>

<h4>As we can observe above, within my initial post I have expressed my thoughts in relevance to this topic, highlighting both the advantages and disadvantages. My peer and teammate, Samuel responded to my initial post expressing his own thoughts on this specific area. As shown above, many of my own perceptions are consistent with Samuel’s, while at the same time he expresses additional thoughts providing a better understanding on my initial post.</h4>
<h4>
However, we should never overlook the fact that Artificial intelligence is a broad field which is utilized in several other areas besides automation writing . For instance, some vehicles nowadays can be driven autonomously. This is achievable if and only if the vehicle is equipped with Artificial Intelligence algorithms which enable the car to behave like a human being and detect any objects to avoid any accidents. In addition to that, AI is utilized in facial recognition, fraud prevention and in many other fields, thus enhancing the quality of our lives (Biswal,2023).</h4>
<h4>
In conclusion, I would like to end the discussion with the following smart quote. Alan Turing once stated that ‘A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human’(Analytixlabs,2022).</h4>

<h4>
Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.</h4>
<h4>
You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.</h4>
<h4>
Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. Your initial post should be labelled "initial post".</h4>
                                            <h4><strong><u>Initial Post:</u> Medical Implants</strong></h4>
                                            <h4> The discussion topic stated above seems really inspiring since it enables my person to acclaim or criticize critically one of the case studies presented within the Association for Computing Machinery website. Among the several case studies included I have chosen to pick up the case in relevance to the medical implants.</h4>
                                            <h4> Speaking more precisely, a technological advancement known as ‘corazon’ is an implantable device used to monitor the health of the heart. By connecting ‘corazon’ with a smart phone application we are enabled to monitor and control the condition of our heart, the most valuable organ in the human body. According to the ACM code of ethics and Professional Conduct we notice that the practices are consistent with the principle 1.1 in relevance to contributing to society and human well-being (Association for Computing Machinery, N.D) . In addition to that, it complies with the regulations of government agencies covering the principle 2.3 as well. Finally the usage of cryptography and the Corazon’s dependence on formal cryptographic algorithms covers the principles 2.3 and 2.9 respectively. It should not be omitted that the engagement of corazon for continuous safety and enhancement existence covers a significant aspect of principle 3.7. </h4> 

   <h4>Keeping the aforementioned details in mind it is obvious that the suitable design of the specific technological advancement enhances its validity and acceptance by the society. Consequently, this event fulfills the computing professionals with satisfaction, since they have succeeded in constructing a technological achievement that exceeds the boundaries of professionalism.</h4> 

  <h4>Nevertheless, there is one aspect that raises concerns. In cases where we need to modify or upgrade ‘corazon’ it would be very challenging due to the nature of the device. However, up until today nothing similar has occurred and therefore we cannot criticize the device for something that has not ever happened.</h4>

  <h4>Simultaneously, we realize that the specific case study fulfils some of the principles in relevance to the BSC Code of Conduct (The Chartered Institute of IT, 2021). In terms of the public interest, it is taken into consideration the public health and safety of citizens, including those with lower incomes. Professional competence and integrity have been applied by sustaining a program which would reveal any weaknesses, and thus leading to continuous progress. Finally, according to all the information given ,we notice that the duty to relevant authority and duty to the professional principles both comply with the case study. </h4> 

   <h4>In conclusion, as IT professionals the compliance of our actions according to the ethics code is required. Especially in the present time, when unethical behaviors dominate in many circumstances, the presence and implementation of the ethics code is considered to be even more essential than any other time(Leonard and Cronan,2001). </h4>

                                            <h4>It is very interesting to observe, in retrospect, how scholars discussed the topic of implantation and ethics. For example, about 20 years ago, Hansson (2005) wrote about “a few promising applications for neural interface implants”, such as brain implants for bladder control. However, most of these ideas are still under development. </h4>

<h4>One reason is the complexity of the brain, which is not yet fully understood, as evidenced by the recent advancements of Neuralink. Another contributing factor is the lack of a unified approach to the ethics of implantation, which overlaps with several subdisciplines of bioethics. For instance, in the same 2005, researchers expressed concerns about the development of an "artificial hippocampus" and other technologies such as mood control and memory enhancement through ICT implants, which were considered as “a threat to human dignity and democratic society” (Erden, 2005).</h4>
<h4>
Regarding the case of the fictitious "Corazón" implant mentioned by my respected fellow student (Kyriacou, 2023), I believe that the first sentence in the device description from the ACM Ethics website, which states that it can be wirelessly monitored and controlled by a phone app, poses a potential threat. Can we be certain that a patient's well-being is secure if such a critical organ is controlled by an external mobile application? Have we exhaustively modeled potential scenarios to ensure that neither Principle 1.2 (Avoiding harm) nor Principle 1.6 (Respecting privacy) are breached?</h4>
<h4>
In this case I can agree that for safety there should only be a one-way connection between the device, with the implant sending information to the app without the opportunity for vice versa.</h4>

<h4>Thank you for this interesting post. </h4>

<h4>The case study presented in this post highlights the importance of adhering to ethical principles in the development of technological advancements. The use of 'corazon', an implantable device to monitor heart health, demonstrates how technology can contribute to society and human well-being while complying with government regulations and ensuring data security through cryptography. However, the potential difficulty of modifying or upgrading the device raises concerns.</h4>

                                                <h4>This case study aligns with the principles outlined in the ACM and BCS codes of ethics and professional conduct (Association for Computing Machinery, N.D) . However, the question remains whether these codes are comprehensive enough to address the ethical considerations of emerging technologies like medical implants. For instance, the principle of avoiding harm in the ACM code might not address the complexities of the long-term impact of medical implants on human health. Furthermore, the codes of ethics do not necessarily provide solutions for situations where a technology's potential benefits are outweighed by its risks..</h4>

                                            <h4><u>My submission:</u></h4>
                                            <h4>
                                                In all industries employees should apply their own principles of ethical behavior. Occupations as such nurses, psychiatrists and police officers own the responsibility to fulfill the standards of ethical behavior for each profession accordingly (Martis,N.D). In particular, as regards my person, as a future computing professional who I am going to work in a company, I will possess the obligation to implement the corresponding principles for my field as well. However, Stahl et al. claim that despite the significance of the application of ethics in computing (Sweeney,2022) and the consequences that might occurred in the case which the principles are not properly respected, several authors who are engaged in researching the ethics of computing, fail to provide applicable recommendations to relevant stakeholders (Stahl et al.,2016).</h4>
                                            <h4>To begin with, any form of computer crime must be avoided. An example of such a crime might be
stealing funds (Berzai,2019) , taking advantage of the skills possessed in computing. Τhis sort of
unethical practices are usually committed by experienced individuals who possess the ability to
access and manipulate computer systems with great ease. Εven though it is a frequent
phenomenon, in relevance to my perspective , money should be earned through hard work and
sweat and not be stolen. Οur professional duties should be performed with absolute honesty and
sincerity. Therefore, I would have never used my knowledge in computing for my personal benefit
and to the detriment of other individuals since it is not consistent with my own personal beliefs.</h4>
                                            
<h4>Another one instance of criminal activity in computing might be the unauthorized access to a
computer, which is known as hacking. We have certainly heard of incidents where hackers have
stolen data from a software system. This can occur so that the perpetrator adopts certain secrets of
another company which may entail in personal profitable decisions or sell secrets to a different
competing company. Consequently, this behavior consists of infringement of the ownership and
proprietorship of a company. As a result, the company is likely to be charged with a huge penalty if
such an action is revealed. Such behavior is completely selfish and should be avoided since it puts
the company at a high risk. In fact, something similar doesn’t represent my own personality and my
beliefs, and thus my actions would never be in line with the idea of hacking.</h4>
<h4>Privacy is an important aspect which is involved within the suitable professional conduct for
computing professionals. However, the exponential growth of data over time increases concerns in
relevance to possible breaches of personal data. This event raises the amount of responsibility that
computing professionals are required to demonstrate since they must be sufficiently capable to
handle, save and exchange the data with safety. Therefore, all the operations performed by a
computing professional should be consistent with the General Data Protection Regulation
principles (Tamburri,2020). This indicates that the operations performed by a computing professional
must be characterized by lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization,
accuracy, storage limitations, integrity, confidentiality and accountability. Therefore, professionals
should handle personal data in respect to the privacy of every individual.</h4>
<h4>Furthermore, even though the advancement of computers constitutes a massive technological
achievement, in some instances it might be catastrophic when used inappropriately. To be more
precise, this event increases the power of the computing professionals, fact which often leads to
exploitation of other individuals. Consequently, the uncertainty and lack of trust that often exists in
an IT professional causes a constant concern. Even though computer professionals should be
required to use their power in a suitable manner, circumstances of unethical behavior are constantly
rising over time. Consequently, we should always keep in mind our purpose and our responsibilities,
setting aside any temptation of exploitation and immoral behavior that can sometimes dominate our
                                                thoughts. </h4>

<h4>The appropriate professional conduct and adherence to the ethical rules will lead to beneficial
results both socially and professionally for my person. More specifically I will earn the trust and
appreciation of other individuals. As a result, moral satisfaction will overwhelm myself which will be
used as a driving force to progress even further professionally. In addition to that, I will gain the
respect of my employer and the recognition of my ethical behavior in relevance to my professional
responsibilities. As a result, it will be more likely to be promoted, which will be of a crucial
significance in regards to my overall career path as a computing professional. Βesides that, as far as
the legal part is considered, there is no concern regarding any fine intended to be imposed against
the company, which will undoubtedly affect the company’s reputation as well.</h4>
<h4>In conclusion, every computing professional possess the obligation to undertake the tasks assigned
with honesty and integrity. The personal interest should be set aside and we should focus on the
benefit of the company. Only in this circumstance we will be able to move forward professionally
    and be accepted socially. </h4>

                                            <h4>
This post has opened the floor for discussion on applying the ethics code to an imaginary situation taken from the Association of Computing Machinery website.</h4>
<h4>
According to legend, an international defense contractor named Q employed facial recognition algorithms (using Machine Learning) to potentially apply automated non-lethal responses, such as tear gas, pepper spray etc. to some threatening individuals in protests. Then a few engineers from the company resigned, expressing concern that the non-lethal weapon had inadequate level of protection, for instance, against a potential replacement tear gas with a lethal poison. After that Q sued them for violating these workers in terms of confidentiality employment agreement.</h4>
<h4>
It turns out that Q failed many rules of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. According to Principle 1.2, the designed systems must avoid harm, and according to Principle 1.1, they must contribute to society and to human well-being, because all people are stakeholders in computing. Also, the systems ignoring Principle 1.6 (respect privacy) and Principle 1.4 (not to discriminate). Especially when we know about racial discrimination in face recognition technology (Najibi, 2020).</h4>
<h4>
Moreover, the engineers were right by expressing their awareness publicly, breaking their confidentiality agreements, based on Principle 1.7 (honor confidentiality), Principle 2.5 (give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks), and Principle 3.1 (ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work).</h4>
<h4>
There are, of course, clear violations of the British Computer Society Code of Conduct too. The Q’s systems failed public interest, regarding public health, privacy, security and well-being, as well as promotion of equal access to the benefits of IT. Q violates Professional Competence and Integrity which is said to avoid injuring others, their property, reputation etc.  And it breaches the BCS principle of Duty to the Profession, which includes accepting personal duty to uphold the reputation of the profession and not take any action which could bring the profession into disrepute.</h4>
<h4>
On the other hand, what can we do about the fact that nowadays business is booming for military AI startups? (Heikkilä, 2020) For example, Pentagon requesting $1.8 billion for Artificial Intelligence (Harper, 2023). Where do the ethics principles end? </h4>

  <h4>Initially I want to thank you for this interesting post.</h4>
  <h4>First of all you have clearly described the case study picked from the association of
computing machinery website. Thus, readers have a clear understanding of the
situation mentioned. It has been correctly stated that several violations have been
occurred in relevance to the ACM code of ethics and professional conduct including
the principle 1.2 concerning the prevention of damage to other individuals and the
principle 1.1 as regards the contribution to society and to human well-being
(Association for Computing Machinery,2018).</h4>
  <h4>In addition to that, you have mentioned rules that have been broken according to
the British computer society code of conduct, achieving an enlightening comparison
between the two codes of ethics referred above(British Computer Society,2023).</h4>
<h4>Keeping in mind the aforementioned information, it is easily perceived that the
need for full recognition and compliance with the codes of ethics is evident,
especially in circumstances where human lives are at risk(ComplyLog,2022).
Therefore, we are required to be fully responsible of our behavior , and always
confirm that our actions do not exceed the pre-determined limits.</h4>

                                            <h4>

Dark UX patterns that mislead or manipulate users with unintended or undesirable consequences are unethical and can harm users (Brignull, 2013). In one case where a customer was using dark patterns to generate revenue, a computer expert raised concerns with a manager, only to be informed that these changes were requested by the customer (‘Case: Dark UX Patterns - ACM Ethics’, 2018). These patterns may violate several principles of the BCS Code of Conduct, consumer protection and accessibility laws, and may undermine trust between users and businesses.</h4>
<h4>
A computer scientist has a moral obligation to use his skills for the benefit of society and to avoid deception and discrimination. The BCS Code of Conduct provides guidance for computer professionals to ensure their work is ethical. The failure of computer professionals and their managers to take a proactive stance in identifying and addressing ethical issues is consistent with their policy to ensure that client designs do not deceive or harm users. It suggests the need for a process.</h4>
<h4>
The use of dark patterns raises ethical, legal, social and professional issues. Computer professionals must ensure that their work meets the highest ethical standards and take proactive steps to identify and mitigate potential ethical issues. Sources such as the BCS Code of Conduct and consumer protection and accessibility laws provide useful frameworks for ethical behavior among computing professionals.</h4>

                                            <h4>Hello Nils,</h4>
<h4>Thank you for this interesting post .</h4>
<h4>I am very glad you have chosen to touch a case study in relevance with the Dark UX
patterns which are responsible for manipulating users as highlighted within your report. In
particular, this is a phenomenon I am totally interested in ,since similar cases are appearing
in an increased manner nowadays(Atkinson,2022).</h4>
<h4>As correctly highlighted this behavior doesn’t comply with the British computer society code
of conduct(Linhoff,2023) . More precisely several principles have been violated including the
protection of the user , and thus the trust between the users and the businesses have been
damaged. However, personally speaking, I would prefer if you paid more attention as
regards with the ACM code of ethics so that a comparison between the two codes could
occur within your report.</h4>
<h4>To sum up, computing professionals’ primary responsibility should always be to benefit
society, setting aside possible personal interests(Association for Computing
Machinery,2018). As such, in order for this phenomenon to occur specific actions must be
avoided as to entrust the avoidance of fraud.</h4>

                                            <h4>

   We live in a world where our quality of life is constantly evolving due to the rapid technological development which we are experiencing over time. McCain (2023) states that ‘technology is growing, evolving, and accelerating at exponential rates. Αlongside this phenomenon , our responsibility for applying and implementing the ethical principles increases as well.</h4>
   <h4>
   Including the field of medicine, which has evolved rapidly in recent decades, any technological achievement must be consistent in accordance with the code of ethics and professional conduct . Τhis is also the case in relevance to the medical device known as ‘corazon’ , which is an implantable device for tracking the health of our hurt. Ιn addition to that, as has been correctly mentioned by my fellow student, other types of implants have been discovered in recent years as such brain implants for bladder control(Lukashevich,2023). In many circumstances within the field of medicine, we observe that specialists in their effort to ensure the health of humanity, which is the ultimate goal, ethical principles usually areomitted.</h4>
   <h4>
   Ηowever, our behavior in general should be consistent with the code of conduct to a broader extent. For instance, within the workplace employees should receive a suitable approach from their managers which will contribute to their smoother adaptation to a new professional environment at the early phase of their career, and afterwards it will speed up their professional growth. In addition to that, Dark UX Patterns is a phenomenon of critical importance, since it is increasingly common nowadays (Association for Computing Machinery, N.D).</h4>
   <h4>
   In conclusion, while our habits diversify over time and the quality of our lives advance mainly due to technological progress, we should be able to adjust the code of ethical conduct accordingly (Linhoff,2023). All rules of conduct are equally essential and must not be broken under any circumstances.  </h4>

<h4>-Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</h4>
<h4>-Which data collection methods would you consider using?</h4>
<h4>-Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations should be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in Unit 10.</h4>
                                            
                                            <h4><strong><u>Answer:</u></strong></h4>
<h4><u>Research Design:</u> In relevance to the research design both exploratory and conclusive research
design are going to be used. More precisely, exploratory research is going to be used in our effort to
explore possible causes of increasing road traffic in Cyprus. At the same time however, conclusive
research design is useful as regards our research topic, since we should search for findings which
display the impacts of increasing road traffic on the environment and individual, and thus to make
our conclusion (Business Research Methodology, N.D.1).</h4>
<h4><u>The nature of the research: </u>My research is placed in the category of causal studies which assess the
affects that one or more variables have on another. More specifically we will assess the effects of
increasing road traffic on the environment and individual. In addition to that we can classify our
research as a pure theoretical development research since we attend to develop and explain
theories as regards to the factors which cause increasing road traffic(Business Research
Methodology ,N.D.2).</h4>
<h4><u>Type of reasoning:</u> Our analysis will be based mainly on inductive reasoning. To be more precise we
will start with observations of increasing road traffic instances and afterwards we will continue with
general theories involving the causes of this phenomenon and the impact on the environment and
individuals. However, for our research we will use deductive reasoning as well in which we will use
our existing knowledge and understanding combined with suitable observations to reinforce our
conclusions as regards the causes of increasing road traffic and the impacts on the environment and
individual(Dictionary.com,2021).</h4>
<h4><u>Purpose of research</u></h4>
<h4><u>Descriptive:</u> We attend to expand our knowledge as regards the causes of increasing Road traffic</h4>
<h4><u>Explanatory:</u> This research is conducted to comprehend the impact of increasing road traffic on the
environment and individuals (Singh,2022).</h4>
<h4><u>Time frame:</u>We gather data over a period of time (longitudinal study) since we should assess the causes and
impacts of increasing road traffic on the environment and individual over time.</h4>
<h4><u>Research Methods:</u></h4>

<h4><u>Quantitative methods</u> This method of research is the most appropriate method since it uses a
systematic way to explore facts and analyze data in measurable forms. Therefore, it gives us the
ability to explain the causes of increasing road traffic and explore the impact of this phenomenon on
the environment and individual. Thus, we will be able to predict the several impacts over the next
few years if the rate of increase remains the same (Hoover,2021).</h4>
<h4><u>Data collection methods(Jotform,2019)</u></h4>
    <h4><u>Primary Research Methods:</u></h4>
 <h4>1)Survey Research (Request gathering responses from a group of individuals according to their
personal thoughts in relevance to the topic).</h4>
<h4>2) Case studies (To provide an in-depth exploration of circumstances similar to the topic
mentioned previously so that we can relate these situations with the current situation and thus gain
knowledge)</h4>
<h4>3) Experiments (Explore the relationship between the increasing road traffic and the
consequences on the environment and individual).</h4>
<h4><u>Secondary Research Methods:</u></h4>
<h4>4) Google scholar (For instance study journals, books …)</h4>

<h4><u>Qualitative methods:</u>Collect data usually using conversational methods, which contribute for the
researcher to receive the experiences, behaviors, emotions and thoughts of the participants in
relation to this topic and provide them with the opportunity to justify these thoughts. Thus, we will
be able to emphasize on their responses and expand our knowledge on this topic.</h4>
<h4><u>Data collection methods</u></h4>
<h4><u>Primary Research Methods: </u></h4>
<h4>1) Interviews (usually one to one interviews)</h4>
<h4>2) Focus groups</h4>
<h4>3) Observations</h4>
<h4>4) Survey/Polls (Request gathering responses from a group of individuals according to their
personal thoughts in relevance to the topic).</h4>

<h4><u>Action research method:</u> After analyzing the issue and the possible impacts we should provide a
study in accordance to how to actively solve the problem(George,2023).</h4>
<h4>1) Survey Research (Request gathering responses from a group of individuals according to their
personal thoughts in relevance to the topic).</h4>
<h4>2) Case studies (To provide an in depth exploration of circumstances similar to the topic

<h4>In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a
Computing field of your choice that utilise the two different types of research methods to
achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide
justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</h4>
<h4>1)Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research
question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts
on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?</h4>
<h4>2)Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the
stated purpose or question?</h4>
<h4>3)In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the
stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming
units.)</h4>
<h4>4)Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit
arguments or evidence?</h4>
<h4>5)How would you enhance the work/paper?</h4>

                                            <h4><strong><u>My submission:</u></strong></h4>
<h4><u>First paper:</u></h4>
<h4>1) The main purpose of the paper is to provide information to readers
about computer security to protect vulnerable resources in computer
systems(Gollmann,2010). After careful reading carried out on this
project material, I realized that the knowledge provided by the project is
in line with my already basic knowledge of the subject but at the same
time there are additional details which expand the limits of my existing
knowledge.</h4>
<h4>2) The research methodology utilized in the above paper is conclusive
research since it is used to verify knowledge to contribute to select the
suitable actions in order to protect vulnerable resources in computer
systems (Business Research Methodology, N.D.). Thus, this is the most
appropriate research design chosen according to the purpose. More
precisely it is mainly chosen the descriptive, conclusive research since
the author describes some facts to provide insights.</h4>
<h4>3) In relevance to data collection and analysis the author selected peer
review sources from google scholar to analyze the data (formal, non-quantitative analysis) and furthermore to provide
knowledge(Jotform,2019).</h4>
<h4>4) Every aspect of the paper is supported by relevant arguments and
evidence.</h4>
<h4>5) In some circumstances some fields can be explored further to provide
the chance to individuals who do not have even the basic knowledge to
fully comprehend the area explained.</h4>
<h4><u>Second Paper:</u></h4>
<h4>1) The main purpose of the paper is to provide information to readers in
relevance to the area of computer simulation and its benefits(Heermann,1990).</h4>
<h4>2) The research methodology utilized in the above paper is exploratory
research since the author seeks to explore the relevant field.</h4>
<h4>3) In relevance to data collection and analysis the author selected peer
review sources from google scholar to analyze the relevant data(formal,
non-quantitative analysis) and furthermore to provide knowledge.</h4>
<h4>4) Every aspect of the paper is supported by relevant arguments and
evidence.</h4>
<h4>5) The chapter of the book can be enriched by relevant pictures to support
learning for the visual learners.</h4>

    <h4>-------------------</h4>
    
                                            <h4><strong><u>Literature Review formative activity</u></strong></h4>
                                            <h4><u>Instrunctions:</u>Submit a brief outline of your literature review this week. You will receive formative feedback on this submission to aid your final submission which is due in Unit 7.</h4>
                                            
                                            <h4><u>Question:</u>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4>-The literature review will focus on research findings and material assessing the causes and impacts of
increasing road traffic on the environment and individual in Cyprus, the Mediterranean Island where I live.</h4>
<h4>-The aim of my review is to critically evaluate available literature which may lead to provide an
investigation to the research field presented above and so that I can successfully cover the research
questions and thus the research objectives.</h4>
<h4>-The audience will be a team responsible for the prevention of increasing traffic on the roads and thus
their subsequent effects. According to relevant information as regards with the available literature, further
investigation of this topic should occur, and thus suitable decisions can be taken to avoid this issue.</h4>

<h4><u>Question:</u>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4>The presence of the literature review is considered very significant due to many reasons. Initially, I am
given the opportunity to present the basic ideas which are retrieved from the available literature and thus
obtain a clear understanding of the content. In addition to that, through the literature review I can discern
the key strengths and limitations of the existing literature and thus take advantage of any possible gaps in
the existing literature within my research project. Therefore, the literature review is very important since
it is given the possibility to my person to critically present the material obtained, my written
understanding and thus to provide answers in relevance to the causes and impacts of increasing road
traffic on the environment and individual in Cyprus.</h4>

<h4><u>Question:</u>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use
to synthesise the literature?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4>-Context: Address the ever-increasing phenomenon of road traffic in the place where I live, which is also
reflecting the global situation and simultaneously highlight the impacts of the aforementioned issue on the
environment and individual.</h4>
<h4>-Perspective: I undoubtedly support the usage of means of transport, which are more friendly to the
environment and humans, as such buses, trains, bicycles and so on.</h4>
<h4>-Framework to synthesise the literature: The most informative peer reviewed sources in relevance to this
topic are reliable online websites ,books and journals. Most likely these formats can be found on either the
internet or a topic library.</h4>

<h4><u>Question:</u>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4>By carefully reading the title, the contents, and the summary of each source I tried to track key words
which have helped me to discern if the corresponding literature was related to the topic examined.</h4>

<h4><u>Question:</u>How is your review structured?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4>The structure of the literature review will be significant as to improve the perception of the reader in
relevance to the topic examined. Initially there is a general introduction which shows the importance of
this issue. After that, within the main body I am clearly presenting my understanding and critically
evaluating each relevant source and finally I come to a conclusion which depends on what has been
presented above.</h4>

<h4><u>Question:</u> What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4><u>Causes of Increasing Road traffic:</u></h4>
<h4>-There are no railways in operation which support trains, trams or undergrounds .The only public transport
which is frequently used are buses.(Mudra,2022).</h4>
<h4>- Saturation in roads (Too many cars in use in roads and not usage of public transportation) (Shawakha et
al., 2018).</h4>
<h4>-In relevance to the numerous attractions that exist and the Mediterranean climate , Cyprus is one of the
most frequent destinations for tourists (FinancialMirror,2022)
<h4>-Poor driving habits.</h4>
<h4><u>Impacts of increasing road traffic on the environment and individual in Cyprus:</u></h4>
<h4>-Τhe chemicals released from vehicles result in damaging the health of individuals and have a negative
impact as regards the local flora and fauna (Atrole et al.,2023).</h4>
<h4>-More travel time in comparison with the usage of trains, trams or undergrounds for long distances which
has a negative effect to the productivity and economy (Supa quick,2022).</h4>
<h4>-Increase in the number of road accidents (Angin &amp; Albrka Ali ,2021)</h4>


<h4><u>Question:</u>What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4><u>Strengths:</u></h4>
<h4>-Focus on the examine area (Provide deeper understanding)</h4>
<h4>-Smooth content flow</h4>
<h4>-Clear expression (Provide clarity and lucidity)</h4>
<h4><u>Limitations:</u></h4>
<h4>-Unavailability of literature in some aspects of the examined field</h4>
<h4>-Lengthy resources (Derail from their main objective)</h4>


<h4><u>Question:</u>Are there any discrepancies in this literature?</h4>
    <h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4>-Discrepancies in relevance to the public transport in Cyprus (Some resources refer that public transport in
Cyprus is well developed)</h4>
<h4>-Discrepancies in relevance to the aspect that increasing road traffic leads to increasing accidents</h4>

<h4><u>Question:</u>What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome of the review?</h4>
<h4><u>Answer</u></h4>
<h4><u>Conclusions:</u></h4>
<h4>-The literature contributes significantly to answering the research questions.</h4>
<h4>-Ηowever there are some limitations which limit to some extent the effectiveness of the research.</h4>
<h4>-We should be careful as regards with the reliability and validity of the literature (Discrepancies).</h4>
<h4><strong>Therefore, it is required to:</strong></h4>
<h4>-Carefully examine the content and the validity of academic resources.</h4>
<h4>-Keep the main point of each resource which provides answers to the research questions and neglect the
details.</h4>
<h4>- Spend some time finding suitable academic resources for the relevant topic.</h4>

                                            <h4>Thank you for submitting your formative.</h4>
 <h4>You have chosen impacts of road traffic in Cyprus as your focus, [from the list of available options in Unit 1].
Noted you have used the ‘guiding questions...’ template for your submission. This can be a useful tool as it
does help to structure the formative, looking forward to the summative discussion. The template that you
have used has allowed a dissection of ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ you will develop the summative.
When you come to complete the summative, do keep a very focused view on your discussion as you only
have 2,000 words for the summative in total. Example, you speak of Cyprus, the global view, the
environment and the individual impact. For 2,000 words the scope here is too board – focus the main
discussion down to a core topic around your subject title so that deep research can take place.
If you have too many discussion points, the content overall will be weak and superficially researched as
there will be too many issues to discuss critically in such a limited word count. Similarly under point 6. In
your formative there is a paragraph there surrounding what impacts the situation currently. Once again be
focused when discussing this in the actual summative.</h4>
<h4>You have discussed limitations of research which is appropriate in an academic context. For the core of your
intended discussion for summative, do ensure that there is a good cross-section of Literature available to
you, to enable the opportunity to engage in deep research.</h4>

<h4><strong>*The below general information is circulated to all students from formative, looking forward to
summative:</strong></h4>

<h4>For the actual summative, ensure that citation is occurring all the way through your content. In-text citation
then needs to be reflected in a list of references at the end of the assignment. That list of references needs
to be in alphabetical order at the end of the assignment.</h4>
<h4>For formative formal academic writing isn’t completely necessary, however for summative ensure that your
writing style is wholly formal and academic. Also remember to apply page numbers to your summative
document. Ensure that your summative has a critical ‘pros and cons’ view of discussion, looking at both the
positives and negatives of the research that you choose to engage with. It is really important not to just look at one side of research. The content of summative needs to examine different publications and look at
different perspectives.</h4>
<h4>As discussed in live seminars and in student support on the online hub, research for this module is just from
secondary research, [and so research that is already in the public domain]. No primary research, [interaction
with actual people] is to take place in this module.</h4>
<h4>Wishing you the best of luck now for your actual summative,</h4>
<h4>With best wishes</h4>

<h4><u>The case:</u></h4>
<h4>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk,
where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has
been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.</h4>

<h4>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses
corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so
    she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study. </h4>

<h4>Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</h4>
<h4><u>Questions:</u></h4>
                                            <h4>
1) If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names
and addresses?</h4>
<h4>2) Suppose Ricardo was responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical
issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</h4>
<h4>3) Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records
department release individuals names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the
Records department to consider?</h4>
<h4>4) Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them
respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not
respond.</h4>
<h4>5) Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What
options are available to Beth?</h4>

<h4><u>Answers:</u></h4>
                                            <h4>
1) According to the ethical issues in relevance to data protection act , if Ricardo is not
responsible for determining allowable access, he shouldn’t release the names and addresses
unless he was given the permission by the relevant individuals(Legislation.gov.uk ,2018).</h4>
<h4>2) If Ricardo was responsible for determining allowable access to the files, after receiving the
permission by the relevant individuals, he should also make sure that Beth will only use the
personal information for the specific purpose noted initially, the personal data will be
appropriately protected and that she will not keep the data for no longer than necessary.</h4>
<h4>3) Since the records department got permission from the specific individuals to release their
personal details to a third party this is not an issue. However, the records department and
Beth should inform the participants of some details in relevance to the research which will
be carried out (for example the purpose of the research, how their data will be used etc.)
and their role within the research as well. This could be achieved by providing an
information sheet for the individuals involved. Participants should also have the right to
withdraw the research at any time they wish.</h4>
<h4>4) Αfter all the procedures mentioned above have been accomplished and we have received
the final response from the participants ,we have the right to use the personal data only for
those individuals who have given permission. Therefore, Beth should not use the personal
data for her research, as regards with the participants who denied permission or didn’t
respond.</h4>
<h4>5) In this situation Beth should obtain the trust of the possible participant to increase the
percentage participating. This should be achieved with the detailed explanation of the
research as previously mentioned, and the suitable way of approaching these to
individuals(kindness, friendliness, honesty etc.)</h4>

                                            <h4><strong><u>Case Study Activity: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</u></strong></h4>

<h4>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.</h4>

<h4>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.</h4>


                                            
                                            <h4><strong><u>My Submission:</u></strong></h4>

<h4>Surveys are probably the most common method used to collect data nowadays. Τhis occurs due to
the fact that it is the most practical approach for retrieving large amounts of data in a short period of
time. Especially nowadays, while technology is growing exponentially, the access and participation of
online surveys through tablets, laptops or mobile phones has significantly come to the forefront
(Outram,2023). Nevertheless, in some cases the process of gathering and handling data through
surveys does not comply with the principles of Data Protection Act.</h4>
<h4>This is a significant issue that occurs frequently, and thus it should be examined carefully and be
addressed immediately. For instance, a relatively recent incident that took place in 2018 was the
scandal in which were involved the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. More specifically, Cambridge
was accused of gathering and sharing data which were collected through innocuous surveys on
Facebook, without the consent of Facebook users in their effort to transmit political messages to
vulnerable groups of people and thus influence foreign elections (Confessore, 2018). Therefore, the
gathered data have been unlawfully collected and utilized for supporting political campaigns for
Trump’s election victory and the Brexit vote. It is significant to be highlighted that the data was
achieved to be accessed through a third-party application which has been generated by a researcher
of the University of Cambridge.</h4>
<h4>However, these incidents are not only limited within the political domain. As regards the field of
healthcare, in some occasions, it has been observed that experienced hackers achieve to access
illegally patients records and sell their personal data, which were collected through surveys. In
particular, Protenus , an organization which is responsible to maintain the protection of the patients’
personal data ,stated that there were 222 hacking incidents in 2018(Garrity,2019). Data as such
credit card information or addresses are valuable to third parties with malicious intentions.</h4>
<h4>The aforementioned incidents are not consistent as regards to the ethical principles, resulting in
various social, professional and legal implications. It is evident that there is no respect in relevance
to the privacy and the personal details of the individuals. In addition to that, malicious intentions
and personal benefits prevail, events that conflict with the ethical ,legal and professional
approaches(Legislation.gov.uk ,2018) . Finally, the reputation is damaged within the companies
involved, and thus the social sector to be irreversibly shaken.</h4>
<h4>To conclude there are not any inappropriate ways of gathering data. Nevertheless , there are
individuals who take advantage of these methods or experienced hackers who achieve to access
unlawfully the data for their personal interest as described in the above cases. Particularly in the
field of data science ,the responsibility is massive, since we are expected to manage huge amounts
of data, and therefore our every movement should be in line with the rules of ethics and the Data
    Protection Act principles as well.</h4>

                                            <h4>- The questionnaire is established as a page on an online website.</h4>
                                            <h4>- The above questionnaire involves both open and closed types of questions.</h4>
                                            <h4>- It begins with closed-ended questions to achieve higher response rates.</h4>
                                            <h4>- Questions progress from the least sensitive to the most sensitive.</h4>
                                            <h4>- Questions progress from general to specific.</h4>
                                            <h4>- Questions progress from factual and behavioral to cognitive.</h4>
                                            <h4>- There are not any unneeded questions included.</h4>
                                            <h4>- The entire length of the questionnaire is relatively small in comparison with other questionnaires.This fact will lead to an increase in the response rate.</h4> 
                                            <h4>- It involves both recall and thought questions.</h4>
                                            <h4>- The questions regarding personal information are correctly placed at the end. 
                                            <h4><strong><u>Question:</u>Why are specific questions included? </strong></h4>
                                            <h4>Most of the questions included in the questionnaire aim to quantify the measure of customer satisfaction and thus enhance the quality of specific services provided from the restaurant(Sincero,2012). In relevance to the demographic data the number of family members, and the age are important questions for the researcher since most likely individuals with more family members or individuals who are older might be taken more into consideration. For the same reason the first and second question exist in the questionnaire as regards the frequency of visit by a customer and the confirmation that the customer visits the restaurant with family or friends.</h4>
                                            <h4><strong><u>Question:</u>Is the form of questions appropriate?</strong></h4>
                                            <h4>- The questions are concise, specific, and clear.</h4>
                                            <h4>- The language used in the questionnaire is simple and understandable for all the respondents coming from different social backgrounds and education.</h4>
                                            <h4>- The style of the questions is consistent (place an ‘X’ mark) (Dawson,2015). 
                                            How can you improve the  questionnaire?</h4>
                                            <h4>- In my opinion the specific questionnaire covers all the major aspects of which an effective questionnaire should consist.</h4>
                                            <h4>- However,personally speaking, it should be added another 1 or 2 open ended questions to make the questionnaire more informative.</h4>

<h4><u>Area of investigation:</u>Assessing the Causes and Impacts of Increasing Road Traffic on the
Environment and Individual, in Cyprus</h4>
                                                
<h4><strong><u>Question:</u>How will you collect it and what analysis would you
hope to perform? How will this answer your research question?</strong></h4>                                           
<h4> <u>Answer: </u>Initially in relevance to any secondary academic sources they can be included journal
articles, chapters included in books and e-books, encyclopedias and dissertations which refer to the
situation prevailing in Cyprus as regards to the causes and impacts of increasing road traffic on the
environment and individual (Harvard Library,2023). These items can be accessed either from the
local library or from google scholar (Deakin University,2023) as well which consists of reliable peer-
reviewed publications. However, since the area of investigation involves a current social issue in
Cyprus, primary sources can be considered equally useful. More precisely, focus groups can be
utilized to conduct effective research on this area. The suitable selection of individuals and groups
can provide the researcher significant information in relevance to the area of investigation.
However, in this case the reliability of the individuals chosen is essential for the validity of the
research. In addition to that, conducting personal interviews with relevant specialists can be a
suitable research method. Nevertheless, this method can be more time consuming. Finally, a survey
would be a suitable approach. Although including open ended questions might be more effective
considering the area of investigation, closed questions can be useful as well. All the amount of data
will be gathered using the first-degree data collection method which implies that the researcher is in
direct contact with the subjects and the collection of data occurs in real time, since this method is
considered to be more direct and effective (Runeson &amp; Host ,2008).</h4>
<h4><strong><u>Question:</u> What analysis would you hope to perform?</strong></h4>                                                

<h4><u>Answer:</u> Primarily I hope to perform qualitative data analysis since the data gathered will include
thoughts,opinions, experiences and relevant non numerical information gathered from suitable
secondary academic sources.</h4>
<h4><strong><u>Question:</u> How this will answer your research question?</strong></h4>                                                

<h4><u>Answer:</u> Gathering information from primary and secondary sources will lead to cross-reference data
which have been retrieved from different academic resources. As a result, we will be capable to
evaluate to what extent several causes lead to increasing road traffic in Cyprus and assess the
degree of validity as regards the impacts on the environment and individual.</h4>

<h4>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.</h4>

<h4>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</h4>

<h4>
    Ethical Concerns:</h4>

<h4>
Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</h4>
<h4>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</h4>
<h4>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</h4>
<h4>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</h4>
<h4>You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses. </h4>
                                            
<h4>
You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.</h4>
<h4>
Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. Your initial post should be labelled "initial post".</h4>

</h4>
                                            <h4><strong><u>Initial Post by Konstantinos Kyriacou </u></strong></h4>

<h4>The discussion topic refers to an employee Abi, who works as a researcher and a statistical programmer at an institute. He is assigned a project from a manufacturer to evaluate the nutritional value of a new cereal product called Whizzz. When the necessary measurements and analyses have been successfully completed, the results obtained by the researcher appear to be contrary as regards the initial beliefs that the product is nutritious, indicating that the specific cereal is harmful.</h4>

<h4>Initially, it is obvious that it would not be ethical to transform the data in such a way to influence the results of the project. Nevertheless, in my point of view, it would be unethical as well to differentiate the statistical analyses in such a way to support both scenarios. I consider that, both results should be addressed fairly, particularly for such an essential topic which might affect the health of thousands of consumers. Therefore, our receptivity towards the product should be determined after accurate measures and reliable results (Outram,2023). Furthermore, the correct interpretation of the results should prevail and thus the research should be conducted at a high level of validity and objectivity.</h4>

<h4>Furthermore, both sides of the results, positive and negative, should be taken into consideration for the evaluation of the nutritional value of the product. Since the researcher has taken the responsibility to provide reliable and valid research, from this point onwards he bears no responsibility for the manner in which the manufacturer will handle the outcomes. Nevertheless, personally speaking in my effort to encourage him to take into consideration all the outcomes I would seek to emphasize the positive, providing him with the perception that the presence of negative elements will not affect the acceptability of the product.</h4>

<h4>In addition to that, as referred to the Data Protection Act, ensuring data security is a fundamental principle. This indicates that the data should not be accessed or processed unlawfully from several third parties without obtaining the consent of the person who has provided the data in the first place, in this case the manufacturer (GOV.UK,2018). Consequently, the researcher is responsible for potential unauthorized access to the results of the project. </h4>  

<h4>In relevance to the legal, social, and professional areas, this approach will be beneficial in all three aspects. More specifically it will be avoided any fine that will be potentially imposed in case of breaking the principles of DPA (Intersoft Consulting ,N.D). As regards the social aspect, honesty and objectivity raise the acceptability and trust received from society. Finally, within the professional sector, the employer will appreciate the professional and honest attitude of the employee, and thus the foundations are being formed for professional growth as well.</h4>

<h4>To summarize, within the above case it is pointed a research in which interpretative validity and reliability are not at the expected levels. Nevertheless, relevant ethical concerns as well as relevant legal, social, and professional impacts should be taken into consideration on this occasion. Consequently, we can discern how significant is for a researcher to provide reliable and valid research.</h4>

    <h4><strong><u>Replies on my initial post:</u></strong></h4>
    <h4><u>Reply by Vasilisa Lukashevich</u></h4>
    <h4>
It's difficult to add anything to Constantinos's (Kyriacou, 2023) comprehensive comment, but I will try.</h4> 
<h4>
From my perspective, the most controversial detail in the Abi case is the possibility of a new product being “harmful”. Of course, the researcher must show the results to the manufacturer, whatever they may be, and after that, theoretically, there should be an option for a second analysis with more detailed clinical nutrition research. According to Weaver and Miller (2017), this case study design includes factors such as:</h4>

<h4>-Test nutrient or dietary pattern,</h4>

<h4>-Background status,</h4>

<h4>-Delivery of test diet or supplement,</h4>

<h4>-Controls,</h4>

<h4>-Length of study,</h4>

<h4>-Blinding,</h4>

<h4>-Study population.</h4>

<h4>For example, considering these factors, the researchers must answer to the questions like:</h4>

<h4>-Are other nutrients being displaced, and will this confound interpretation of the study?</h4>

<h4>-Is there an ethical and meaningful comparator?</h4>

<h4>-Is the priority to study the population likely to benefit from the product or to achieve generalizable results?</h4>

  <h4>Researchers emphasised that each approach has its strengths and weakness, and no single method is perfect in nutrition research. </h4>

<h4>Constantinos's initial post emphasizes the significance of maintaining ethical integrity in research (Kyriacou, 2023). Manipulating data to influence results is considered unethical and violates the principles of scientific integrity and honesty (Mager & Galandini, 2020).</h4>

<h4>The comment rightly emphasizes the importance of presenting both positive and negative findings to ensure transparency and unbiased reporting. This approach enables stakeholders to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the research (Mager & Galandini, 2020)</h4>

<h4>Constantinos correctly highlights the responsibility of researchers to protect data and adhere to legal regulations(Kyriacou, 2023). The Data Protection Act ensures the security and privacy of research data, preventing unauthorized access and use (GOV.UK, 2018).</h4>

<h4>The forum post effectively focusses on the ethical considerations in reporting contradictory research findings, encompassing aspects such as ethical integrity, balanced reporting, and data protection. By referencing sources, this critique highlights the importance of ethical conduct in research and its implications for the wider scientific community and society.</h4>

    <h4>I'm a little confused about an option in the task that states, "There are no right or wrong answers here." I suppose all sides—consumers, manufacturers, and researchers—will not be satisfied when the potentially harmful product eventually reaches the market. It carries huge risks for the manufacturer, research institution reputation, and regulators. So, fortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to be questionable. According to Katan (2007), ethical research implies publishing the results, whether they are favourable or not to the client, and providing full disclosures for all participants.</h4>

<h4>Moreover, I think the task missed a lot of valuable detailed input to be a good judge. In what country did Abi conduct the research? What does the contract between the two sides (manufacturer and researcher) say? How many rounds of tests were provided? In what exact way could the new cereal be harmful and for whom? For example, many people believe that any amount of sugar is very harmful, but it is not true for everyone.</h4>

<h4>According to the recommendations of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, before promoting a particular product, at least two double-blind, randomised control trials should be conducted. (Ruckers, 2016).</h4>

    <h4><strong><u>My response to the previous post:</u></strong></h4>
<h4>
    Hello Vasilisa,</h4>

<h4>Initially I want to thank you for this interesting post . I would like to agree with your statement that as far as morality is concerned there is always an objective distinction of ethical and unethical approach in a certain situation (Lukashevic,2023). Therefore, morality is not a matter that depends to our own opinion, as correctly highlighted, especially in a case which relates to a product that will eventually reach the consumers' hands and thus it is likely to harm their health. Consequently, in such circumstances it is advisable to be carried out a double check to ensure the suitability of the products manufactured and supplied to the consumers (Rucker & Rucker ,2016).</h4>

<h4>I strongly suggest that as a society we should change the way of thinking in a general manner. More precisely, we should prioritize the common interest and eliminate behaviors which are based on our personal benefit disregarding any further consequences which will likely occur towards the public. Only in this manner we will be able to enhance the quality of life of our society. Taking into consideration my own thoughts on this topic, I would be interested for your own point of view as well. </h4>

    <h4><strong><u>Initial Post:</u> Ethicals concerns regarding data by Nils Linhoff</strong></h4>
<h4>
As a statistician and researcher, Abi must consider ethical issues when evaluating the nutritional content of the cereal Whizzz. Abi must uphold morality and objectivity in his research.</h4>

<h4>First of all, altering data values would be highly unethical and go against the rules of scientific inquiry. Falsifying or changing data can have serious legal and professional repercussions, damage to the public's health if harmful products are misrepresented, and undermine the validity of the study (Resnik, 2015).</h4>

<h4>Second, Abi has a moral duty to give the manufacturer both positive and negative analysis. To make well-informed decisions, findings must be reported transparently and in detail. By supplying all the data, Abi makes sure that the manufacturer is fully aware of any potential benefits or risks Whizzz may have for your health. This enables the manufacturer to make wise choices regarding the public disclosure and promotion of the product (Dhakal, 2016).</h4>

<h4>Insofar as he is able to predict the outcomes with reasonable certainty, Abi is also accountable for how his program's results are used. He should make the manufacturer aware of any potential risks and restrictions related to the positive analyses, even though he has no control over how the manufacturer will use the results. Mitigating misunderstandings and improper use of the results is made easier by providing thorough documentation and explanations (Dhakal, 2016).).</h4>

    <h4>Abi has a few options if he thinks the manufacturer will only highlight the positive outcomes. He can clearly state in the report that both positive and negative analyses were carried out and that a balanced presentation of findings is required. To ensure broader scrutiny and public awareness, Abi can also share the findings with regulatory agencies or independent research groups. Consulting with legal experts can explore additional options if there are worries about potential harm or violations of legal requirements (Lesser & Nordenhaug, 2004). </h4>

   <h4>
Hello Nils,</h4>

<h4>Thank you for this interesting post,
It is important that you highlighted the fact that any manipulation of data would be contrary to the ethical principles of objectivity and accuracy (Tomasetti,2023), which may lead to serious implications concerning the legal and professional field. Therefore, as correctly stated, Abi has the obligation to provide reliable details mentioning both the positive and negative outcomes of the analysis of the product (Linhoff,2023).</h4>

<h4>However, in our attempt to avoid the case that the manufacturer will provide only the positive results, I support that this situation should be handled in a different manner. I consider that several warnings to the manufacturer as regards the severe legal, social and professional consequences in case of the distortion of the outcomes, would be more effective and would prevent the manufacturer for providing only the positive results . What is your point of view on this reasoning?</h4>

    <h4><strong><u>Summary post by Constantinos Kyriacou:</u></strong></h4>
    <h4>
The above collaborative learning discussion constitutes a significant component of the current module since it enables us to discern the ethical and unethical approaches as regards a specific research of evaluation of the nutritional value of a new cereal product called Whizz. This discussion enabled us to strengthen our awareness in ethical research and thus it will enhance the quality of research we will be undertaking for the capstone module of our master’s degree during the next semester.</h4>

<h4>Considering the reply I received from Vasilisa, it was added that within the researcher's attempt to fully confirm that the product is either harmful or nutritious, further analysis should be conducted approaching in further detail the clinical nutrition background of the product (Lukashevich,2023). In addition to that it is highlighted that there is no ideal research method in nutrition research, bearing in mind that each approach has both strengths and limitations.</h4>

<h4>In relevance to the reply received from my peer Nils it is apparent that the content of my initial post agrees as regards his perception to the ethical approach for the specific case, while reinforcing our common beliefs with relevant references on reliable academic resources (Linhoff,2023). This fact contributes as a supportive dynamic of the concepts expressed within my initial post, and thus the reader can rely more heavily on the information provided.</h4>

<h4>In conclusion, as previously mentioned, this collaborative discussion contributes in enhancing our knowledge so as to distinguish ethical and unethical approaches when conducting a research. Based on the effort undertaken and time spent for conducting the discussion I consider that the learning outcomes were fully fulfilled. </h4>

    <h4><strong><u>Title:</u> The causes and impacts of increasing road traffic
on the environment and individual in Cyprus</strong></h4>
    
    
<h4><u>Literature Review</u></h4>
<h4><u>Introduction:</u></h4>
<h4>The ever-increasing phenomenon of road traffic which has arisen exponentially in
the last two decades is an issue which influences several countries (Vacala,2019).
As a result both the environment and society are negatively affected. Consequently,
the major aim of the review is to provide clear insights as regards the causes of
increasing road traffic in Cyprus and highlight the main impacts of this phenomenon
on the environment and individual, evaluating the available secondary literature
sources provided on the internet. It is significant to highlight that a similar situation
prevails in several other countries and thus most of the information provided can be
generalized to many other countries as well.</h4>
<h4><u>Causes:</u></h4>
<h4>To begin with, in Cyprus there are no railways in operation supporting other means of
transport as such trains, trams, or undergrounds. As a matter of fact, the usage of
public means of transport is significantly limited. In general, most residents who live
in Cyprus use their private cars for travelling. Even tourists who visit the island for
vacations prefer to rent a private car since the transport system on the island does
not feature advanced specifications for public transportation . Nevertheless, some
academic sources highlight that the public transport in Cyprus is well developed
(Mudra,2022), supporting their viewpoint that buses are used on a regular basis.
This fact does not justify in any way the failure to exploit alternative public means of
transports, especially for an island which is particularly well developed in several
areas. Considering the preceding situation described, residents are implicitly forced
to own a private car to facilitate their movement around the island. Το be more
precise, the last measurement carried out ,reveals that the number of registered
passenger cars in 2020 have been calculated to be almost 580 000(CEIC,2021).</h4>
<h4>This figure consists of a high proportion according to Cypriot standards,
if we consider that the adult population in Cyprus the last few years is approximately
1 million. It is worth mentioning that in 1980 there were 92.207 thousand registered
cars, figure which indicates that the quantity has been increased sixfold by 2020. As
a matter of fact, it is observed that there is a constant upward trend and thus it is
predicted that within the next decades the figure will rise even further. This
occurrence is perfectly logical since, despite the fact that during previous decades
the transportation system was similar to the current, the last decades an exponential
growth of technology has been highlighted (Bongomin et al.,2020) and thus material
goods which within previous decades were considered to be luxury items, in the
present time they constitute ordinary elements to facilitate everyday life of the
individuals.</h4>
<h4>Besides, it is significant to refer that Cyprus is one of the most frequent destinations
for tourists (FinancialMirror,2022). After the invasion in 1974 there was a definite
necessity for economic growth. Therefore, the development of the tourism
infrastructure was the only path to the economic recovery. Τhe following decades
witnessed a significant economic upturn, with the highest tourist arrivals being
recorded in 2001 when the total revenues exceeded 2 billion Euros(Clerides &amp;
Pashourtidou,2007). Nevertheless, this event led to excessive traffic congestion and
thus the dissatisfaction of the citizens was prevalent. In general , the tourism can be
considered as both a blessing and a curse for a society. Τaking a look back at the
past there have been many cases in which after a war, the countries involved
depend on tourism for economic reconstruction and advancement of the influenced
quality of life, fact which justifies the prevailing investment pattern in Cyprus after
1974.</h4>
<h4>Despite the economic prosperity that has prevailed on the island in recent decades,
the quality of the roads in Cyprus remain unaltered. It is doubtful if it exists a road
without a hole, crack, or a detachment on its surface, as a result the traffic
congestion to become more apparent. Even though highways are in a much better
condition, on this occasion we encounter the issue of narrow street lanes. There are
no five-lane or even four-lane roads, a structure which is very common in foreign
countries. This event consists of the principal cause of traffic congestion on
motorways during weekends, when road trips occur more frequently. However,
several studies have indicated that in terms of the road quality, Cyprus has received
an average value of 5.38 points out of 7 during the period between 2006 and 2019
by the responsible evaluation committee. This is a relevant high score if we consider
that the average score in 2019 among 141 countries was 4.07 points (The Global
Economy.com, N.D). Nevertheless, my personal belief is that the road architecture
does not represent the high quality of living in Cyprus, and thus the necessity of
upgrading on this field becomes crucial.</h4>
<h4><u>Impacts:</u></h4>
<h4>The consequences of this phenomenon are unavoidable both on the environment
and the individual in Cyprus. To begin with ,the chemicals released from vehicles
result in damaging the health of individuals (Atrole et al.,2023). According to relevant
research, it is proven that individuals who are exposed in increased volumes of
carbon dioxide are more vulnerable to diseases including inflammation, bone
demineralization, kidney calcification, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction
(Jacobson et al.,2019). It is important to highlight that CO2 nourishes cancer as well.
It is medically verified that the inhalation of carbon dioxide results in the growth of
immature cancer cells and thus increasing the possibility of being diagnosed with the
disease. In fact, it consists of the second most common cause of mortality on the
island. Between the years 2004 and 2011 the average annual deaths due to this
disease was estimated to be 1011, quantity which constitutes a percentage of
approximately 0.1% of the entire population (Farazi,2014). Taking into consideration
more recent evidence, the health ministry announced recently that over the last
decade Cyprus addresses 3700 average annual cancer cases which constitutes a
significantly large number taking into consideration the overall population of
Cyprus(Kades,2023).</h4>
<h4>Additionally, increasing road traffic results in increasing in the number of road
accidents (Angin &amp; Albrka Ali ,2021) considering that the likelihood of a conflict is
greater. Some academic resources indicate that this event does not affect directly
the ever-increasing road accidents, attributing this phenomenon to irresponsible
drivers. Agapiou (2021) supports that the primary factors of the overall accidents in
Cyprus is alcohol ,careless driving and speed .To some extent I partially agree with
the previous statement on the basis that if all the drivers were completely
responsible, there would have been no accidents. However, in such a large
population this is impossible and thus I strongly believe that increasing road traffic
entails increasing in the number of road accidents as well. According to relevant
studies, between 2008 and 2020 they have been noted 10. 542 accidents including
729 deaths and 15.173 injuries in Cyprus (Frotcom,2021) , events that constitute a
significant increase in comparison with previous decades.</h4>
<h4>Furthermore, more travel time is required to reach our destination in comparison with
the usage of trains, trams or undergrounds for long distances which has a negative
effect as regards the productivity and economy of the society (Supa quick,2022).
Assuming that on average every individual in Cyprus spends approximately one
hour per day more on travelling, the magnitude of difference in economy if this
period was productively utilized, would be apparent. Karagiannakis et al. (2013)
states that the productivity between the years 1996 and 2011 decreases gradually.
To be more precise during the period between 1996 and 2001 the average
productivity growth rate was 2.7% while over the next five years it fell to 1.7 %. It is
highlighted that after 2008 the productivity growth has fallen to 0.6 %. Although the
factors which led in such a large decrease very likely to be several, it could be offset
if Cypriots had more time at their disposal to produce labor. Referring to recent
evidence, during the last few years it has been noted a downward trend of the
quality of life in Cyprus since average revenues are low and thus individuals are
unable to satisfy their needs.</h4>
<h4>In relevance to the environmental issues , it is highlighted that even though the
Carbon dioxide ensures the survival of living organisms, the excessive amount
released in the atmosphere from vehicles can lead to disastrous effects. To be more
specific, Carbon dioxide mixes with other gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, and thus
preserves the greenhouse effect. These substances have the property to absorb
solar rays and as a result to enrapture the heat within the Earth’s atmosphere. This
fact results in increasing the temperature of Earth and thus the climate is maintained
at the optimal temperature levels for humans and other species to live (Kweku et
al.,2018). Τhe meteorologists predict that without the existence of greenhouse
gases including CO2 the average temperature of our planet would be -18 degrees
Celsius. Nevertheless, the excessive exposure of Carbon dioxide derails the
greenhouse gases from the optimal level, and thus causing a severe phenomenon
known as global warming (Amaechi &amp; Biose ,2016). It is estimated that the
temperature in Cyprus will rise approximately 4.5-5 degrees Celsius by the end of
the century (Giannakis et al.,2020). As a result, ice caps melt and thus the sea level
rises. According to researchers It is estimated that by 2050 the surface of the sea
will be risen approximately 30 centimeters (Nasa,2020). Additionally, all living
organisms which cannot survive in high temperatures will disappear in the future,
affecting the diversity of wildlife. Finally, undesirable weather events such as
heatwaves, heavy downpours and wildfires are more frequently occurring. This fact
is undeniable, since as a resident of Cyprus I experience these phenomena
frequently.</h4>
<h4>In addition to that, it is estimated that the environmental phenomenon of acid rain will
become a severe issue within the next decades. The acids are generated in the
atmosphere when fossil fuels are burnt. Therefore, taking into account the increasing
rate of air pollution by vehicles, greater amounts of acids will be generated in the
atmosphere which at a later stage will fall to the earth surface usually in the form of
rain forming the phenomenon known as acid rain as a result the acidity of the ground
to be affected (Grennfelt et al.,2020) . Consequently, this fact destroys the trees,
which considering their nature ,they cannot survive in such acidic soil. In addition to
that, acid rain affects the acidity within the marine environment and thus the water
becomes harmful for the marine organisms , since they cannot survive in such acidic
water. In general, it affects several wildlife organisms whose nature is not able to
survive in such an acidic environment. For instance, in relevance to the plants which
are being endangered in Cyprus include among others the Centaurea akamantis,
Delphinium caseyi and Cedrus brevifolia. On the other hand, as regards the living
organisms ,endangered species include Hierophis cypriensis, Ovis musimon ophion
and Mobula mobular . Given this, endangered species is a current issue that should
be taken into consideration since it is apparent that the rate of increase of species in
recent years causes great concern on maintaining the balance of our natural
environment.</h4>
<h4><u>Conclusion:</u></h4>
<h4>To summarize, it has been reported some of the major causes which are responsible
for the current situation of increasing road traffic in Cyprus and it has been analyzed
on a statistical basis the consequences of increasing road traffic on the environment
and individual through both exploratory and conclusive research. Qualitative and
quantitative methodologies were essential to fulfill the research objective.
Nevertheless, renewed investigation should be carried out since most of the studies
occurred, provide details up to 2020.</h4>

    <h4><u>Transcript: </u></h4>
<h4>Greetings to everybody!</h4>	 
<h4>My name is Konstantinos Kyriakou, and I am a student of University of Essex Online. I am currently attending the research method and professional practice module which will constitute fundamental support in accomplishing the capstone project with success. As such, this opportunity has granted my person the capacity of relinquishing an auditory report of my findings. Regarding this, I look forward to relaying this information to my attending audience at the moment. As such, I have constructed a research proposal for COVID-19 analysis. My research proposal was centered around the most recent global pandemic that allowed for various industries and establishments to cecum to instability. The existence of this pandemic, exuding amongst other issues, exceeding cases of carriers of the virus until today.  </h4>
<h4>The following research has been implemented as to explain in further detail, certain fields which might not be examined so far. By combining reliable resources, we are able to identify several gaps, and thus retrieving relevant information will allow for the opportunity to fill in those gaps and provide a more comprehensive analysis.</h4>
<h4>Given the opportunity of today’s presentation, attention will be primarily focused on the most significant findings which have taken place within the Covid-19 period and predict the pandemic situation for the upcoming future. We will answer questions spawned from this topic such as, the potential existence of a significant difference of the death rate for individuals who have suffered from Covid-19 in different countries or among different age groups or even gender, alluding to certain social issues. In addition to that, we will seek to make predictions for the future, taking into consideration the confirmed cases of the disease over time from the beginning of the pandemics existence in 2019 until the present day.</h4>
<h4>In synopsis, the objectives of this research is to identify the countries most affected by the pandemic and the corresponding death rates for each country, as well as identifying the morality rates by age group and gender. In continuum towards the end of the research, a data-driven reference occurs in regards to the prediction of the proceeding situation within the near future and following that process, an additional task must occur, that of the identification of the most effective ways of protection. Consequently, following the end of the consumption of this research, the audience will obtain a comprehensive analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic according to the research proposed, providing reliable information which will also contribute in addressing similar cases at a future stage.</h4>
<h4>Proceeding on to the next slide, my findings present the prevalence of the most concentrated amount of cases globally as per individual countries. As such, it is notable to mention the highly concentrated number of cases present in the United States with a total number of 107.346.013, this finding having a stark contrast to the placement of the second most concentrated country in reported cases, India. India yields less than 45 million cases up to the present day. This finding must be noted as per the enormous difference in population, as India possesses approximately four times the population of United States, however the spread of the disease was much greater in the United States(Geography Host,2023). The primary cause of this phenomenon may be attributed to the failure of citizens to comply with the methods of prevention, which will be discussed at a later stage of the presentation. Additionally, in relevance to the remaining countries, cases range between 33 and 41 million as shown on the table(Wolrdometer,2023a).</h4>   
<h4>The following bar chart contains the percentage of death rate with regards to the previously aforementioned countries. In relevance to this, the highest percentage prevails in Brazil of almost 2 percent. This figure indicates that almost 2 out of 10 individuals who have suffered previously from Covid-19 in Brazil have passed away. In contrast, the lowest rate is shown in Japan where the mortality rate exists at only 0.22 percent for this condition, which is only the one ninth of the corresponding rate in Brazil. The explanation for this incident is the advanced technology utilized in hospitals within the country, leading to increased medical care effectiveness (Kamae et al., 2020). As noted within the findings, a relationship exists between the support given by medical professionals and the smooth recovery of patients, as such this sentiment is noted above within the contrasting results of the Japanese and Brazilian mortality rates in relation to Covid-19. Lastly, as it is observed within the bar chart the remaining countries range between 0.4 and 1.2 percent.</h4> 
<h4>Subsequently, my efforts were to correlate the death rate with the age group, thus the following histogram was constructed. As per the findings, It is obvious that older individuals are more likely to pass away given they are infected by the virus. Specifically, as to be more precise approximately 15 percent of the older individuals who exceed the age of 80 years old , pass away in the event of their infection. This indicates that approximately 15 out of 100 individuals who exceed the specific age limit pass away given their infection. Additionally, the percentage is elevated for individuals whose age range between 70 and 80 years old, with the percentage of fatality to be equal to 8%. On the other hand, children and adults younger than the age of 20 years old, are indicated to be placed lower at a meniscal scale as displayed by the graph(Worldometer,2023b). This occurs due to the fact that older individuals are more sensitive to ailments and their immune system is less powerful in comparison to a younger individual(Lawton,2020).</h4>  
<h4>The following pie chart demonstrates the death rate of individuals contaminated by the covid-19 virus, in relation to the gender. It is revealed that 62 % of the patients who passed away from Covid-19 were male and only the remaining percentage of 38 % were females. This is a logical consequence if we consider that relevant research demonstrates that more than one third of males smoke tobacco globally, in comparison with females which are placed at 8% (Ritchie,2019).As to further elaborate, cigarettes contain substances which attach to the surfaces of the lung walls and as a result limit the amount of oxygen that can enter within the human lungs and thus influencing its performance(Gibbs et al.,2016). The situation seems to be exasperated when individuals are affected by the Covid-19 virus, which further affects the condition of the respiratory system causing massive discomfort and difficulty in the patient's breathing. Apart from this, it is proven that females have healthier habits rather than males, this influencing a significant component of the human body’s robustness to diseases(Farhud,2015). This phenomenon alluding to recent advancements performed in research evidence, showing that the percentage of males who drink alcohol regularly is significantly greater than the respective percentage of females (Ritchie & Roser,2018).</h4> 
<h4>In relevance to symptoms experienced by patients, most of them appear to experience more than one symptom among those indicated in the following bar chart. However, the most common symptoms experienced appear to be fever, cough and shortness of breath. To be more precise, approximately 80 percent of the patients experienced fever, a percentage which is equal for those who experienced a cough as well.Additionally, it is important to note the rate of slightly above 30 percent that experienced shortness of breath. In relation to the previously addressed information, it should be highlighted that among these symptoms, the most insidious is the one affecting the breathing system for the reasons referred to previously. The distribution of the remaining symptoms are displayed in the bar chart(Wolrdometer,2023c).</h4> 
<h4>Moving on to the next slide, the trajectory of confirmed cases over time from December 2019 is portrayed, as per the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 appeared until today. It is observed that during the initial year of the Covid-19 pandemic, an upward trend of the number of cases was portrayed, which almost reached 5 million. Despite the fact that this figure decreased within the following six months, a significant increase was perceived by the end of 2021, as the amount of cases increased significantly exceeding 10 million cases. Following this event, the amount divided in half within the following months, this alluding to a decline of the spread. However, a rise was signified by the end of 2022, reaching a peak of 27 million confirmed cases, thus indicating the outbreak of the disease. Fortunately, from this point onwards, a demonstration of constant decrease is apparent with the latest results highlighting that the number of confirmed cases are maintained at a decreased existence as displayed in the line chart (Wolrdometer,2023d). Despite recent positive indications regarding the virus, epidemiologists highlight that the end of the pandemic has not arrived yet, demonstrating their concern for a potential outbreak in the near future (Kwekha-Rashid et al.,2023).</h4> 
<h4>To avoid this incident, compliance with methods of prevention is necessary. Initially, Covid-19 vaccinations were deemed a great denominator for the reduction of side effects of the disease and a cause for weakening the virus. Thus, the spread of the disease is restricted and the amount of cases is constricted (Kaplan & Milstein,2021). However, a large amount of the population support that the specific vaccine might be of harm as per chronic use, this event repelling them from getting vaccinated (Saeed et al.,2021). Additionally in regards to the spread of the virus, relevant research has shown that the main factor of spreading the disease is through the patients’ saliva. Consequently, taking this event into consideration, we can limit the spread of the disease using masks(Tso & Cowling,2020), keeping the required distances(Sun & Zhai,2020), and limiting unnecessary travelling. Lastly, in support of the containment of the virus, maintaining rules of hygiene as such the regular use of antiseptic for washing hands might can constitute deterrent factor to the spread of the virus(Roy et al.,2020).</h4> 
<h4>In order to proceed successfully with carrying out the entire procedure of research, we should utilize the quantitative type of research method. In particular, the retrieval of numbers and measurable forms so that we can construct data visuals and thus further investigate the field of Covid-19 pandemic, were necessary for this approach. The research design implemented is maintained as conclusive research since retrieving relevant numerical data will lead to several conclusions as indicated previously. Specifically, the use of descriptive research should be used to provide comprehensive answers to questions such as; Where is the pandemic mostly spread, how the death rate is distributed per country , age group and gender, what are the most common symptoms and when was the peak of the disease since the beginning of its existence. In addition to that, we should definitively explain the cause and effect relationship between utilizing several methods of prevention along with the spread of the virus(Wright et al.,2016).</h4> 
<h4>Alongside with the previous notion of collecting information, academic integrity should be taken seriously into consideration. When conducting research from secondary academic sources we should be acting with fairness and honesty by giving credit to other publishers when referring to their research. This can be achieved by referencing each piece of information gathered from the work of others. Otherwise, the failure to acknowledge the work of other publishers consist of an academic offence and may lead to incurring a penalty or even worse to being removed from the course for academic dishonesty(McHaney,2016).</h4> 
<h4>During the research several artefacts will be established to fulfil the research aims and objectives. Specifically, a table should be created as to illustrate the most affected countries of Covid-19, as well as formulating two bar charts illustrating the death rate per country and the most common symptoms of the patients. In addition to that a histogram should display the age groups most affected by the pandemic indicating the death rate by age group. Furthermore, a pie chart is utilized to note any differences as regards to those individuals who passed away as per gender and lastly a line chart summarizes an overview of the pandemic along time, thus giving us the ability to forecast the most likely scenarios with regards to the continuation of the pandemic.</h4> 
<h4>The suitable planning of proposed activities should be carried out during the research, as it is required in order to make sure that the project is on schedule and is expected to be implemented within the anticipated time period. Initially, the research problem should be fully identified and the research objectives and aims should be discerned. Following this process, relevant literature should be examined and evaluated in order to be able to set more specific questions which can be answered and satisfy the objectives of the research. Proceeding this process, the most suitable study design should be chosen as to enable us to move forward to the collection of relevant data and data visualization for better understanding. The end of the process entails detail processing, analyzing data and drawing our own conclusions as to write the report based on the relevant findings. The distribution of time for each task is indicated in the displayed timeline (The University of Western Australia, N.D).</h4>

However, there is a reading material providing major elements in project management, risk assessment and effective ways of managing change and uncertainty. Lastly, there is a self-test quiz which provides the students the ability to evaluate the knowledge gathered from the reading material in the current Unit.Τhis formative activity signifies the end of the entire module and lays the foundations for the upcoming capstone project which consists the latter part for the completion of my masters degree.</strong></h4>
